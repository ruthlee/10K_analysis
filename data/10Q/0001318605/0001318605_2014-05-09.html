 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Use of Estimates </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period,
including revenue recognition, residual value of operating lease vehicles, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of financial instruments and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Unaudited Interim Financial Statements </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March&nbsp;31, 2014, the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the
three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 and other information disclosed in the related notes are unaudited.&nbsp;The condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements at that date.&nbsp;The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared on the same basis as the
annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods presented. The
condensed consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future year or interim period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Revenue Recognition </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize
revenues from sales of Model S and the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits, such as zero emission vehicle and greenhouse gas emission credits, as well as sales of electric
vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units. We recognize revenue when: (i)&nbsp;persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii)&nbsp;delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer
acceptance; (iii)&nbsp;fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv)&nbsp;collection is reasonably assured. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For Model S sales, revenue is
generally recognized when all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers. In certain circumstances, we may deliver a vehicle to a customer without all of the options ordered by the customer, provided that such options do not
limit the functionality of the vehicle. In such cases, we continue to defer the related revenue based on the undelivered items&#146; fair value, as evidenced by the contractual price of the option in stand-alone transactions, where available, or
using the selling price hierarchy where such prices do not exist. Additionally, if a customer purchases a vehicle option that requires us to provide services in the future, we defer the related revenue based on the undelivered items&#146; fair value
and recognize the associated revenue over our expected performance period. As of March&nbsp;31, 2014, we had deferred $30.2 million, $13.9 million and $3.9 million related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and service plans, access to our
Supercharger network and Model S connectivity, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had deferred $27.6 million, $10.3 million and $0.7 million related to these same performance obligations, respectively. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Resale Value Guarantee </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and financed their
vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners, and in October 2013, we introduced this program in Canada. Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39
months after delivery for a pre-determined resale value. Although we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery, we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases. Accordingly, we
defer and amortize to automotive sales revenue the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straight-line basis, over the contractual term of the guarantee program (i.e., the proxy operating lease term). Similarly, we
capitalize and depreciate the cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales over the same period. If a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value
guarantee term, or the resale value guarantee is forfeited, any unamortized deferred revenue (including the amount of the resale value guarantee) and operating lease vehicle net book value is then recognized in automotive sales and cost of
automotive sales, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The resale value guarantee amount represents management&#146;s best estimate as to the resale value of
the Model S vehicle and related vehicle options during the 36 to 39 month period after delivery. Since we are depreciating our operating lease vehicles to the resale value guarantee amount, which approximates the expected salvage value of our
operating lease vehicles at the end of their economic useful life (i.e. the end of their expected operating lease term), we will adjust our depreciation estimates as needed, if the expected salvage value is projected to be lower in future periods.
As we accumulate more actual data related to the resale experience of Model S, we may be required to make significant changes to our estimates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We regularly review all of our marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We provide a warranty on all vehicle, production powertrain components and systems sales, and we accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle
or production powertrain component or system is delivered to the customer. Warranty reserves include management&#146;s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it
becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data. For new vehicles, warranty reserves are based on management&#146;s best estimate of projected warranty experience until adequate historical data is
accumulated. Our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our resale value guarantee vehicles as such actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred. For the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014, warranty costs
incurred for our resale value guarantee vehicles was $1.2 million. We may have material changes as we accumulate more actual data and experience. We review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected
future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The portion of the warranty provision which is expected
to be incurred within 12 months from the balance sheet date is classified as current, while the remaining amount is classified as long-term. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We began recording warranty reserves with the commencement of Tesla Roadster sales in 2008. Initially, Tesla Roadsters were sold with a
warranty of three years or 36,000 miles, which we extended to four years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. Tesla Roadster customers had the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of
the New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36,000 miles, provided they were purchased within a specified period of time. </P>

the vehicle&#146;s battery, although the battery&#146;s charging capacity is not covered. Model S customers also have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover
additional services for an additional four years or 50,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. The battery pack&#146;s charging capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or any Extended Service

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable
inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.
Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of our common stock warrant liability,
which expired in May 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised primarily of money market funds,
are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices for similar securities. Our short-term marketable securities are classified within Level II of the fair value
hierarchy.</P>

aggregate principal amount of $465.0 million. As of August&nbsp;31, 2012, we had fully drawn down the aforementioned facilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we issued in January 2010 a warrant to the DOE to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. Upon the completion of our
initial public offering on July&nbsp;2, 2010, this preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase up to 3,090,111 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.54 per share. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2013, we entered into an amendment with the DOE under which we agreed to repay all outstanding principal and interest payments under
the DOE Loan Facility by December&nbsp;15, 2017 prior to the warrant vesting start date of December&nbsp;15, 2018; therefore, the DOE warrant was no longer expected to vest and its fair value was reduced to zero as of March&nbsp;31, 2013. During the
three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013, we recognized other income for the reduction of the fair value of the DOE warrant in the amount of $10.7&nbsp;million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2013, in connection with the closing of our offerings of common stock and 2018 Notes, we paid $451.8 million to settle all outstanding
loan amounts of $441.0 million under the DOE Loan Facility, including principal and interest, as well as an early repayment penalty of $10.8 million which was recorded in interest expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. Upon termination
of the DOE Loan Facility, $29.3 million previously held in a dedicated debt service account was released by the DOE. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the fourth quarter of 2011, Daimler engaged us to assist with the development of a full electric powertrain for a Daimler Mercedes-Benz
B-Class EV vehicle. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we entered into a development agreement to assist Daimler with the development of a full electric powertrain for a Daimler Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV vehicle. Pursuant to the development
agreement, Daimler will pay us up to $33.2 million for the successful completion of certain at risk development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014, we delivered prototype samples and
recognized $1.7 million in development services revenue. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013, we completed a milestone, delivered prototype samples and recognized $6.5 million in development services revenue related to the
Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Toyota RAV4 Program </I></B></P>

battery pack, charging system, inverter, motor, gearbox and associated software for integration into the electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Additionally, we provide Toyota with certain services related to the supply of the electric
powertrain system. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized revenue of $15.1 million and $14.4 million in automotive sales revenue, respectively. Our production activities under this program are expected to end in
2014. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility located in Fremont, California from New United
Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). NUMMI has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont site which could affect soil and groundwater, and until recently, were undertaking efforts to address these conditions. These conditions are
now being addressed by us and NUMMI. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has documented and managed the environmental issues and we completed a reasonable level of diligence on such environmental issues at the time we purchased the
facility, we cannot determine the potential costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination with any certainty. Based on management&#146;s best estimate, at the time of the facility purchase, we estimated the fair value of the environmental
liabilities that we assumed to be $5.3 million. The fair value of these liabilities was determined based on an expected value analysis of the related potential costs to investigate, remediate and manage various environmental conditions that were
identified as part of NUMMI&#146;s facility decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence efforts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We reached an agreement with
NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land purchase for any known
or unknown environmental conditions, and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such remediation activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred
in the first four years of our agreement, subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing. Through March&nbsp;31 2014, remediation costs of $2.3 million had been incurred by NUMMI. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the ten-year anniversary of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has been spent on the
remediation activities, whichever comes first, NUMMI&#146;s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the Fremont site. At that point in time, we have agreed to
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability and we have released NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for NUMMI&#146;s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement. As of March&nbsp;31, 2014 and
December&nbsp;31, 2013, we accrued a total of $5.5 million and $5.5 million related to these environmental liabilities, respectively. As we continue with our construction and operating activities, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of
environmental liabilities may change materially. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Other Commitments and Contingencies </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time
to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our
results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit
was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The current complaint, which
makes claims against Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, seeks damages and attorney&#146;s fees on the basis of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr. Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions, including with respect to
the safety of Model S. This case is brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla&#146;s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to
defend against it vigorously. As we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit, it is not possible for us to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred nor can we estimate the range of any
potential loss. </P>

$180.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. In connection with the issuance of these additional notes, we entered
into convertible note hedge transactions and paid an aggregate $78.7&nbsp;million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 0.3&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at
a strike price of $512.66 per share for the warrants relating to the 2019 Notes, and a total of approximately 0.5&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a strike price of $560.64 per share for the warrants relating to the 2021 Notes. We received
aggregate proceeds of approximately $50.8 million from the sale of the warrants. </P>

design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We are currently producing and selling our second vehicle, the Model S sedan. Model S is a four door, five-passenger
premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. The Model S inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster. The Tesla Roadster was launched in
2008 and was the first commercially produced and federally compliant EV in the United States. We commenced deliveries of Model S in June 2012 and delivered 22,477 vehicles in 2013. In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of our Model X
crossover vehicle. We currently expect to have production design Model X prototypes on the road by the end of 2014 and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network. We are also building a network of Superchargers in the United States, Europe
and Asia to allow Model S owners to have the ability to travel long distances without a limitation on range by charging their cars at a very fast rate for free. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014, we recognized total revenues of $620.5 million, an increase of $58.7 million over total
revenues of $561.8 million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013, primarily driven by the launch of European Model S deliveries which commenced in August 2013 and powertrain component sales to Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) for the
Toyota RAV4 EV; partially offset by a decrease in regulatory credit sales. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gross margin for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014
was 25.0%, a significant increase from 17.1% for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. Higher vehicle production volume, manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies and component cost reductions contributed to the year-over-year increase in
gross margin. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 were $81.5 million, an increase
from $54.9 million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. R&amp;D expenses in the first quarter of 2013 included activities to homologate Model S for markets outside of North America as well as ongoing R&amp;D activities related to Model S,
Supercharging and other programs. Higher R&amp;D expenses in the first quarter of 2014 reflected our accelerated engineering work on Model X and continuing efforts to adapt Model S for international markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During 2013, we significantly increased our sales and service footprint both in North America and Europe, as well as opened our first store in
China. With the continued global expansion of our customer support infrastructure and the business in general in 2014, selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $117.6 million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014,
compared to $47.0 million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We ended the quarter with $2.58 billion in cash and cash
equivalents, current restricted cash and short-term marketable securities, which was a significant increase from cash of $848.9 million held at the end of 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion

approximately $787.6 million from the 2019 Notes and $1.18 billion from the 2021 Notes. We incurred a total of $31.1 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of these notes
which we recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of these notes. Under the terms of these notes, 0.25% and 1.25% coupon interest per annum on the principal amount
of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, respectively, is payable semi-annually in arrears on March&nbsp;1 and September&nbsp;1 of each year, commencing on September&nbsp;1, 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the offering of these notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase
(subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.6&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a price of $359.87 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $524.7 million. In addition, we sold
warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 2.2&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 per share and a total of
approximately 3.3&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share. We received $338.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of
warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $359.87 to $512.66 per share for the 2019 Notes and from $359.87 to $560.64 per share for the 2021
Notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the end of the first quarter, the underwriters of our Notes&#146; offering notified us of their exercise in full of their
overallotment options related to our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes offerings. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes. In connection with
the issuance of these Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and paid $78.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants to the note hedge counterparties, and received aggregate proceeds of approximately $50.8 million from the sale of
the warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of these additional notes and to effectively increase their overall conversion prices.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2013, we made significant progress in increasing production aided by manufacturing, design and quality improvements as well as through
strong efforts from our supply chain. In 2014 we expect to see an even further increase in production to about 1,000 vehicles per week by the end of the year as we expand our factory capacity and address supplier bottlenecks. Battery cell supply
will continue to constrain our production during the first half of 2014, but should significantly improve in the second half of the year as our cell supplier brings new production capacity online. Based on our higher production level, we currently
expect to deliver slightly over 35,000 Model S vehicles worldwide in 2014, representing a more than 55% increase over 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the first
quarter of 2014, we received a significant sequential increase in global net orders for Model S. This upward trend was driven by our greater global footprint and increasing consumer awareness of Model S. Given the potential we see in Europe and
Asia, we expect sales in those regions combined to comprise almost twice that of North America by the end of 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through the first half
of 2013, we had delivered Model S vehicles solely to customers in North America. In August 2013, we started European deliveries of Model S. Similar to the initial launch of Model S in the United States and in Canada, we experienced an increase in
our average selling price during the third quarter of 2013 due to the start of delivery of European Signature Series vehicles, and a higher mix of 85 kWh vehicles and other options in all markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2014, we commenced deliveries in China at successful customer events in Beijing and Shanghai. Model S is priced similarly to Model S
in the United States, with the addition of only unavoidable taxes, customs duties and transportation costs. While we believe that our pricing is consistent with our objective of offering transparent and fair pricing in every market, this pricing
strategy is counter to prevailing auto industry practices. As such, Model S in China is priced comparable to a mid-sized premium vehicle in China instead of a large luxury vehicle. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to expand in China as quickly as possible because we believe that the country could be one of our largest markets within a few years.
In addition to increased deliveries into China, our expansion into the right hand drive markets, such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia will occur starting this summer. We have not delivered Model S vehicles outside of North
America and Europe in volume; thus, we may face difficulties meeting our delivery plans in Asia and right hand drive markets later this year, which may impact our ability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and financed their
vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners, and in October 2013, we introduced this program in Canada. Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39
months after delivery for a pre-determined resale value. We account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases and accordingly, we defer and amortize to automotive sales revenue the initial purchase consideration
less resale value guarantee amount on a straight-line basis, over the contractual term of the guarantee program. Similarly, we capitalize and depreciate the cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of
automotive sales over the same period. If a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term, the amount of the resale value guarantee and operating lease vehicle net book value are then recognized
in automotive sales and cost of automotive sales, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The resale value guarantee amount represents management&#146;s best
estimate as to the resale value of the Model S vehicle and related vehicle options during the 36 to 39 month period after delivery. We are depreciating our operating lease vehicles to expected salvage value of our operating lease vehicles at the

end of their economic useful life (i.e., the end of their expected operating lease term), and we will adjust our depreciation estimates as needed if the expected salvage value decreases in future
periods. As we accumulate more actual data related to the resale experience of Model S, we may be required to make significant changes to our estimates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2013, we provided the resale value guarantee to approximately 5,200 Model S deliveries in North America. During the first quarter of 2014,
we provided the resale value guarantee to an additional 1,181 Model S deliveries. We expect the penetration rate of the resale value guarantee to remain at the current level in the near-term. Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee
currently do not impact our cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program has adversely impacted our near-term revenues and operating results by requiring the
amortization of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. Although lease accounting will continue to adversely impact our revenues and operating results as this and similar programs initially ramp up, as time passes, the
amortization of existing deferred revenues and costs will begin to partially offset this adverse impact. Furthermore, while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles&#146; resale value may
be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could adversely impact our gross margin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In early 2014, we announced new leasing and financing options in Germany as well as other European markets in collaboration with a number of
global financial partners. In April 2014, we launched Tesla Finance in the United States to directly offer leasing to small and medium-sized businesses. Leasing through Tesla is now available in 21 states and the District of Columbia, with plans for
introduction in more states and Canada this year. If customer interest in these financing options is significant, we may be directly or indirectly subject to resale value risks for the Model S. We continue to evaluate a number of other customer
financing products as a way to better serve our growing customer base. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to sales of Model S, we continue to recognize
automotive sales from our supply of powertrain systems to Toyota for the Toyota RAV4 EV. However, Toyota is expected to end the current RAV4 EV model this year. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2012, we began work on a full electric powertrain under the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV program and in 2013, we continued to provide
development services and deliver prototype samples to Daimler. We have substantially completed our development services under this program and production of electric powertrains and battery packs have just commenced. Similar to our previous
development services agreements, due to timing differences that may arise between the recognition of milestone revenues and the underlying costs of development services, the gross margin from our development services activities has varied from
period to period and may vary in future periods. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Significant cost improvements for Model S were achieved in 2013, including part cost
reductions as well as manufacturing efficiencies. We expect some of these trends to continue as we execute on our roadmap of achieving further component cost reductions and benefit from economies of scale. We therefore expect our automotive gross
margin to increase to about 28% in the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding potential zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credit sales and assuming a lower option take rate as we get to a more mainstream market and a lower percentage of people take the high
performance options on Model S. If we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives, our ability to reach our gross margin goals would be negatively affected. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognized $129.8 million in ZEV credit sales in 2013 which contributed to our gross margin.
Although ZEV credit revenue was strong in 2013, over 90% of ZEV credit sales were recognized during the first half of 2013. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014, we did not recognize any ZEV credit sales and we expect the contribution
of ZEV credit revenue to remain low in the future relative to our automotive sales as we continue to grow our sales outside the United States. While we will pursue opportunities to monetize ZEV credits we earn from the sales of our vehicles, we do
not plan to rely on these sales to be a contributor to gross margin. Our business model and financial plan are not predicated on such ZEV credits. Other regulatory credit sales recognized during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 were $11.6
million, compared to $17.1&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype
of the Model X crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. We have accelerated the design and engineering for Model X and the final studio release of Model X has just been completed. The tooling process
has started with several suppliers and we expect production design prototypes to be ready in the fourth quarter of this year. We plan to ramp production in the spring of 2015. Our ability to launch the Model X program on time and cost efficiently is
dependent upon a variety of factors, including supplier readiness, engineering completion and testing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to continue to expand our
stores and service infrastructure in order to expand our geographical presence and to provide better service in areas with a high concentration of Model S customers. To help drive demand in new geographic areas, we have also begun complementing our
store strategy with sales capability within service centers to more rapidly and efficiently expand our retail footprint. As of the end of 2013, we had stores, galleries and service centers in over 110 locations around the world, and plan to increase
our total number of locations by more than 75% in 2014, including growing rapidly in multiple regions in China. We continue to build service infrastructure in advance of demand to ensure that after-sale services are available when and where needed,
and to help create further demand. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the end of May 2013, we announced the significant expansion of our Supercharger network as well as
plans to reduce charging time at our Superchargers. Since the time of our announcement, we have been installing Superchargers at an accelerating pace and currently have a network of 100 Superchagers. We are continuing to expand our network in North
America and Europe, and have recently opened three Supercharging sites in China. We plan to install another 200 Superchargers globally in 2014, including locations in Japan and Hong Kong. If we experience difficulties in finding suitable sites,
negotiating leases or obtaining required permits for such locations, our planned expansion of such Superchargers could be delayed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Operating expenses and capital expenditures are expected to significantly increase in 2014, as we plan to invest in the long-term growth of
the company. In 2014, we plan to significantly expand production capacity for Model S and Model X, kick-off the construction of the Tesla Gigafactory, invest in our customer support infrastructure, complete the development of Model X and start early
design work on our third generation vehicle, which we refer to as &#147;Gen III&#148;. Our R&amp;D expenses in particular are expected to increase as design and engineering work accelerates on Model X and overall product development but decrease as
a percentage of revenue over time. R&amp;D expenses for the second quarter of 2014 are expected to grow sequentially by approximately 30% as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Our SG&amp;A expenses will continue to grow in absolute terms as we
expand our customer and corporate infrastructure globally. SG&amp;A expenses for the second quarter of 2014 are also expected to grow sequentially by approximately 15% as compared to the first quarter of 2014. We expect capital expenditures to be
approximately $650 to $850 million for 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have recently indicated our intention to build the Tesla Gigafactory, a facility where we
intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material, cell, module and battery pack production in one location. While we have not finalized a site for this facility, we currently expect to start working on at least two
locations in parallel in order to minimize risk of delays arising after groundbreaking. We currently expect the facility to be built on a lot between 500 and 1,000 acres in size, with up to approximately 10&nbsp;million square feet of production

implementation, the Tesla Gigafactory is expected to have 6,500 dedicated Tesla and production partner employees. We currently plan to commence supplying battery packs manufactured at the Tesla
Gigafactory for our vehicles, including the Gen III vehicle, and stationary storage applications, in approximately three years. The Tesla Gigafactory is on plan to begin battery cell and pack production in 2017 and is currently expected to attain
full production capacity in 2020, which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of approximately 500,000 vehicles annually as well as stationary storage applications. By the time the Gigafactory reaches full, annualized production in
2020, we expect battery pack production capacity to reach 50 GWh. Of this, we expect to build 35 GWh of cell production capacity at the Tesla Gigafactory and purchase 15 GWh of cells from other manufacturers, potentially including Panasonic. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the Tesla Gigafactory will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs of greater than 30% on a per
kWh basis by the end of the first year of volume production of Gen III. The total capital expenditures associated with the Tesla Gigafactory through 2020 are expected to be $4-5 billion, of which approximately $2 billion is expected to come from
Tesla. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While our plan is to attempt to produce lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs for our Gen III vehicles at a new Tesla
Gigafactory, our plans for such production are at a very early stage. We have no experience in the production of lithium-ion cells, and accordingly we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell production. Planning discussions
with Panasonic and other potential production and supply chain partners continue to progress well. We recently entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Panasonic to advance work on the Tesla Gigafactory project. Although planning discussions
with production and supply chain partners continue to progress well, to date we have not formalized such partnerships. In addition, the cost of building and operating the Tesla Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the Tesla
Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the first quarter of 2014, certain conditions with respect to the
closing prices of our common stock in accordance with the terms of our 2018 convertible senior notes (2018 Notes) were met and accordingly, the 2018 Notes are convertible at the holder&#146;s option during the second quarter of 2014. Upon conversion
of the 2018 Notes, we will be obligated to pay cash for the principal amount of the converted notes and we may also have to deliver shares of our common stock in respect of such converted notes. Any conversion of the notes prior to their maturity or
acceleration of the repayment of the notes could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, results of operations and financial condition. Should such closing price conditions continue to be met in future quarters, the 2018 Notes
will be convertible by their holders during the immediately following quarter. Similarly, if certain conditions are met with respect to our 2019 Notes or 2021 Notes in future quarters, the 2019 Notes or 2021 Notes will be convertible by their

$555.2 million during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. Vehicle, options and related sales represent revenues related to deliveries of Model S, including vehicle options, accessories and destination charges, vehicle service and sales of

million, an increase from $540.8 million during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase in vehicle, options and related sales was primarily driven by Model S deliveries which began in August 2013 in Europe. During the three months
ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, we delivered 6,457 Model S vehicles and 4,901 Model S vehicles, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, we began
offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners, and in October 2013, we introduced this program in Canada. Under the
program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months for a pre-determined resale value. We account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases and
accordingly, we defer and amortize to revenues the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straight-line basis, over the contractual term of the guarantee program. If a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back
to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term, the amount of the resale value guarantee is then recognized in automotive sales. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014, we delivered 1,181 Model S vehicles under the resale value
guarantee program.&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;31, 2014, we had $270.7 million in deferred revenues and $290.6 million in resale value guarantee related to Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31,
2014, we recognized revenue of $23.2 million in automotive sales related to this program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Powertrain component and related sales for the
periods presented were related to powertrain component sales to Toyota under the RAV4 EV supply and services agreement. Powertrain component and related sales for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 was $15.1 million, a slight increase from
$14.4 million during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Development Services </I></P>

powertrain for a Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV vehicle and during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized development services revenue of $1.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Development services revenue for the three
months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 relates primarily to the delivery of prototype samples to Daimler under this program while development services revenue for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013 includes revenues for the achievement of a
milestone and from the delivery of prototype samples to Daimler under this program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit </I></B></P>

direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including amortized tooling costs, royalty fees, shipping and logistic costs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales also includes adjustments to warranty
expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. </P>

S in the United States and financed their vehicle and vehicle options through one of our specified commercial banking partners, and in October 2013, we introduced this program in Canada. Under the program, we capitalize the cost of Model S into
operating lease vehicles and depreciate the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales on a straight-line basis, over the contractual term of the guarantee program. If a customer decides not to sell
their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term, the remaining operating lease vehicle net book value is then recognized in automotive sales. As of March&nbsp;31, 2014, we recorded $447.0 million in operating lease vehicles,
net, related to Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014, we recognized $14.5 million in cost of automotive sales related to operating lease vehicle depreciation under this program. Our
warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our resale value guarantee vehicles as such actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred. For the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014, warranty costs incurred for our
resale value guarantee vehicles were $1.2 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gross profit during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 was $155.1 million, an
increase from $96.3 million during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher vehicle production volume, manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies as well as component cost reductions. </P>

quality, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. Also included in R&amp;D expenses are development services costs that we incur, if any,
prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured. Development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of
revenues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">R&amp;D expenses during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 were $81.5 million, an increase from $54.9 million during
the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. R&amp;D expenses in the first quarter of 2013 included activities to homologate Model S for markets outside of North America as well as ongoing research and development activities related to Model S,
supercharging and other programs. Higher R&amp;D expenses in the first quarter of 2014 reflected our accelerated engineering work on Model X and continuing efforts to adapt Model S for international markets. The $26.6&nbsp;million increase in
R&amp;D expenses consisted primarily of a $7.3 million increase in costs related to Model X and right-hand drive Model&nbsp;S engineering, design and testing activities, a $6.8&nbsp;million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to a
larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants, a $6.7 million increase in employee compensation expenses, a $4.5 million increase in expensed materials
primarily to support our Model X and right-hand drive Model&nbsp;S, and office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business. </P>

the business. The $70.6&nbsp;million increase in our SG&amp;A expenses consisted primarily of a $33.0&nbsp;million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and
higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business, a $16.2 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing

primarily to our convertible senior notes due 2018, 2019 and 2021. We capitalize interest to assets under construction during the period of significant asset construction. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized

aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. We incurred approximately $31.1 million of
debt issuance costs in connection with these notes, which we initially recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of the notes.&nbsp;The interest rates are fixed at
0.25% and 1.25%&nbsp;per annum for the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, respectively, and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March&nbsp;1 and September&nbsp;1 of each year, commencing on September&nbsp;1, 2014. During the three months ended
March&nbsp;31, 2014, we recognized $0.2 million of interest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and $1.2 million of accrued coupon interest expense related to these notes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with these
notes from the respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option of $163.6 million for the 2019 Notes and $321.2 million for the 2021 Notes in stockholders&#146; equity.&nbsp;The resulting debt discounts on the 2019 Notes
and 2021 Notes are being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.89% and 5.96%, respectively, over the contractual terms of these notes.&nbsp;During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014, we recognized $4.7 million of
interest expense related to the amortization of these debt discounts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of

net, consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability and foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and
losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Prior to the expiration of the DOE warrant in May 2013, the DOE warrant had been carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other
income, net. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other income, net, during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 was $6.7 million, a decrease from $17.1 million during
the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. In March 2013, we entered into a fourth amendment to the DOE Loan Facility which, among other things, accelerated the maturity date of our DOE loans to December&nbsp;15, 2017; therefore, the DOE warrant
was no longer expected to vest. We recorded the reduction in fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability of $10.7 million in other income, net, during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. Other income, net, during the three months
ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 included $6.7 million and $6.4 million of favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. </P>

primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions as we continued to increase our Model S deliveries in Europe, following the commencement of European Model S deliveries in August 2013. </P>

securities, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will continue to provide us with adequate liquidity based on our current plans. These capital sources will enable us to fund our ongoing operations, continue
research and development projects, including those for our planned Model X crossover and certain future products, such as our third generation vehicle, establish and expand our stores, service centers and Supercharger network and to make the
investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce Model X and to continue to ramp up production of Model S as well as make investments in the Tesla Gigafactory. We may seek additional capital resources to partially fund certain

applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of the 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the second quarter of 2014. As such, we reclassified the $589.9

the $2.00 billion aggregate issuance of 2019 and 2021 Notes, $338.4 million from the sale of warrants in March 2014 in connection with the issuance of these notes, and $35.7 million received from the exercise of common stock options by employees and
the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $524.7 million related to the purchase of convertible note hedges in March 2014 in connection with the issuance of these notes, $30.3 million of issuance costs
and $2.3 million related to principal payments on our capital leases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.7 million during

$12.7 million related to our planned quarterly repayment of loan principal under the DOE Loan Facility, and $1.5 million related to principal payments on our capital leases. </P>

2018 Notes were met and therefore, holders of the 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the second quarter of 2014. As such, we reclassified the $589.9 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes to current liabilities on our condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of March&nbsp;31, 2014. Should such closing price conditions be met in the second quarter of 2014 or a future quarter, the 2018 Notes will be convertible by their holders during the immediately following quarter. Similarly, if
certain conditions are met with respect to our 2019 and 2021 Notes in future quarters, the 2019 and 2021 Notes will be convertible by their holders during the immediately following quarter. </P>

2012 to customers in North America and to European customers in August 2013. Through March&nbsp;31, 2014, a majority of our revenues have been denominated in U.S. dollars, with a growing exposure to euro and Norwegian krona; however, a portion of
our costs and expenses during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014 was denominated in foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, euro and British pound. Accordingly, if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against
currencies where we have a net short exposure, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase which may adversely impact our operating results. We commenced Model S deliveries in China in April 2014
and plan to commence Model S deliveries in certain other countries in Asia in 2014. As we continue to launch Model S overseas, we may have greater revenues than costs denominated in other currencies, in which case a strengthening of the dollar

alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The current complaint, which makes claims against Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, seeks damages and
attorney&#146;s fees on the basis of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr. Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions, including with respect to the safety of Model S. This case is brought on behalf of a putative
class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla&#146;s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend against it vigorously. </P>

ability to use our manufacturing processes as planned for higher volume production while maintaining our desired quality levels and efficiently making design changes to ensure consistently high
quality. The Model S is an all new vehicle which we are producing with new employees using new equipment and therefore our production processes are still maturing. To produce a vehicle that meets our quality standards requires us to carefully
analyze each step of our production plan, improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue to train our employees. Our suppliers also must produce new products in sufficient quantities and quality levels to meet our demand. Certain
suppliers have experienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements, and we continue to focus on supplier capabilities and constraints. Any disruption in maintaining our production level of
Model S could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have limited experience in
the high volume delivery of our Model S vehicles. We have gradually ramped production of Model S and we intend to continue to increase the production rate significantly over the next several quarters. Furthermore, we have only recently commenced
deliveries in Europe and Asia and have not delivered Model S vehicles outside of North America and Europe in volume; thus we may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans in Asia and other right hand drive markets later this year,
which may impact our ability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals. If we are unable to increase the production rate and ramp up deliveries globally to match our production rate of Model S, this could result in negative publicity, damage our brand

have introduced a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques, such as aluminum spot welding systems, which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry, and Model S has a number of new and unique design features, such as a 17
inch display screen, newly designed retractable exterior door handles and a panoramic roof, each of which poses unique manufacturing challenges. Model S production and deliveries will continue to require significant resources and we may experience
unexpected delays or difficulties that could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity for Model S, or cause us to miss planned production targets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
operating results. Additionally, sustaining high volume production and doing so in a manner that avoids significant cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, may be difficult.

numerous purchased parts which we source globally from over 300 direct suppliers, the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers for these components. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other
automobile manufacturers, the majority of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from single sources. To date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we do not
maintain long-term agreements with a number of our suppliers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply
relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term, or at all, at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we believe that we will be
able to secure alternate sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be
time consuming, costly and may force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle&#146;s design. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This supply chain exposes us to
multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for Model S, as well as for our powertrain component sales activities. For example, earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in Japan in March 2011 could negatively impact our
supply chain. We have in the past experienced source disruptions in our supply chains, including those relating to our slower-than-anticipated ramp in our Model S production goals for 2012. We may experience additional delays in the future with
respect to Model S and any other future vehicle we may produce. In addition, because we have written agreements in place with the majority, but not all of, our suppliers, this may create uncertainty regarding certain suppliers&#146; obligations to
us, including but not limited to, those regarding warranty and product liability. Changes in business conditions, wars, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our
suppliers&#146; ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we experience significantly increased demand, or need to replace certain existing suppliers, there can be no assurance

that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us, at all, or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to
meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. In the past, we have replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards. The loss of any single or limited source supplier or
the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and
operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost and delay. We
have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made, and we may experience similar cost increases in the future.
Additionally, we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them cheaper to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts
to control and reduce supplier costs, our operating results will suffer. Additionally, cost reduction efforts may interrupt or harm our normal production processes, thereby harming Model S quality or reducing Model S production output. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, a failure by our suppliers to provide the components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our
performance electric vehicles such as Model S could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, in October 2013, we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with Panasonic
Corporation in order to address our anticipated short- to medium-term lithium ion battery cell needs. While we expect that this supply agreement, as amended, will provide us with sufficient cells for the next few years, we may not be able to meet
our long-term needs, including for our third generation electric vehicle, which we refer as &#147;Gen III,&#148; and other programs we may introduce, without securing additional suppliers or other sources for cells.&nbsp;If we cannot secure such
additional suppliers or sources, we could experience production delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. </P>

business, our financial condition and operating results will suffer. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our production costs for Model S were high initially due to
start-up costs at the Tesla Factory, manufacturing inefficiencies including low absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, higher logistics costs due to the immaturity of our supply chain, and higher initial prices for component parts during the
initial period after the launch and ramp of Model S. As we have gradually ramped production of Model S, manufacturing costs per vehicle have fallen. While we expect further cost reduction efforts undertaken by both us and our suppliers will continue
to reduce costs during the next several quarters, there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve planned cost reductions from our various cost savings initiatives, and the failure to achieve such savings would negatively affect our ability to
reach our gross margin and profitability goals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture
our high-performance electric cars, assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel. We may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of Model S and powertrain manufacturing facilities and the recent
launch in Asia. Furthermore, if we are unable to produce Model X pursuant to our plan due to cost overruns or other unexpected costs, we may not be able to meet our gross margin targets. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, in the future we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses
to promote our vehicles, including through the use of traditional media such as television, radio and print, even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited as we have to date relied upon unconventional marketing efforts. If
we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed. Furthermore, many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control. For
example, the costs of our raw materials and components, such as lithium-ion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels, could increase due to shortages as global demand for these products increases. Indeed, if the popularity of electric
vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology, shortages could occur which would result in increased material costs to us or potentially limit our
ability to expand production. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our long-term success will be dependent upon our ability to design, build and achieve market

is dependent on market acceptance of the Model S sedan and future electric vehicles we introduce. In the United States, there is no guarantee that Model S will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public, especially in the long-term.
As we expand in Europe and enter into Asia, there is no guarantee that customers in these markets will embrace our vehicles and if they do not, demand for our vehicles could be lower than our expectations. For example, we have experienced greater
initial success in selling Model&nbsp;S vehicles in Norway than in the rest of Europe. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will
be able to design future electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models, including the Model X crossover, will become commercially viable. To date, we have publicly revealed only an early prototype of
the Model X. To the extent that we are not able to build Model X to the expectations created by the early prototype and our announced specifications, customers may cancel their reservations, our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose
confidence in us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we have also announced our intent to develop Gen III which we expect to produce at the Tesla Factory after
the introduction of Model X. We intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our Model S. Importantly, we anticipate producing our Gen III vehicle for the mass market and thus we will need a
high-volume supply of lithium-ion cells at reasonable prices. While our plan is to attempt to produce lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs for our Gen III vehicles at a new Tesla Gigafactory, our plans for such production are at an early
stage and we have not yet finalized a site for the construction of the Tesla Gigafactory nor completed a factory design. In addition, we have no experience in the production of lithium-ion cells, and accordingly we intend to engage partners with
significant experience in cell production and to date we have not formalized such partnerships. In addition, the cost of building and operating the Tesla Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the Tesla Gigafactory may take longer to
bring online than we anticipate. If we are unable to build the Tesla Gigafactory in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells for Gen III at reasonable prices and thus are forced to rely on others to supply us with
lithium-ion cells for Gen III, our ability to produce our Gen III vehicles at a price that allows us to sell Gen III profitably could be constrained. Finally, we have very limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and
production of multiple models of vehicles, such as Model S (including any variants we may introduce such as right-hand drive), Model X and Gen III. While we intend each of our production vehicles and their variants to meet a distinct segment of the
automotive market, our vehicles may end up competing with each other which may delay sales and associated </P>

historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as
enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As technologies change in the future for automobiles in general and performance electric vehicles specifically, we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to

2011, Congress passed and the President signed the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010. The new law requires NHTSA to establish minimum sounds for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles when travelling at low speeds. NHTSA issued a
notice of proposed rulemaking in 2013 and plans to finalize a rule as soon as sometime in 2014 with an effective date that could be implemented by September&nbsp;1, 2015. This will begin a three year phase-in schedule for establishing these minimum
sounds in all electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Adding this artificial noise may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles, which would materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial

primary contributor to our revenue starting in the fourth quarter of 2012. We intend in the longer term to derive substantial revenues from the sales of Model S, Model X, Gen III and future electric vehicles. Further, we have only produced an early
prototype of the Model X crossover and have only recently started production of Model S for Asia. Our vehicle design and our engineering, manufacturing&nbsp;and component supply plans for Model S may continue to be adjusted. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The battery pack in the Tesla Roadster and Model S and the battery packs that we sell to Toyota and Daimler makes use of lithium-ion cells. We
also currently intend to make use of lithium-ion cells inany future vehicles we may produce. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as
well as other lithium-ion cells. Extremely rare incidents of laptop computers, cell phones and electric vehicle battery packs catching fire have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These events have raised concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of
cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. We have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell&#146;s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells. However, we
have delivered only a limited number of Tesla Roadsters and Model S sedans to customers and have limited field experience with our vehicles, especially Model S. We have also only delivered a limited number of battery packs to Toyota and Daimler.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our Model S or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. We may
have to recall our vehicles or participate in a recall of a vehicle that contains our battery packs, and redesign our battery packs, which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of
lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve us, could seriously harm our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our manufacturing facility. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause
disruption to the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage
or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor&#146;s electric vehicle, especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to the Tesla Roadster or
Model&nbsp;S, may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our electric vehicles. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P>

vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains such as the Toyota RAV4 EV or the upcoming Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. For
example, our vehicles use a substantial amount of software code to operate. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced, and changes to software may have unexpected effects. Model S issues
experienced by customers include those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery. Although we are attempting to remedy the Model S issues experienced by our customers in a rapid manner by

our electric powertrain. In May 2009, we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during
the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider, which is the partially assembled Tesla Roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall for some of our Tesla Roadsters after the 12 volt, low
voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. In June 2013, we initiated a recall of slightly more
than a thousand Model S vehicles to inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process. Rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in an upright position. Failure of this component may
have resulted in the collapse of the rear seat back during a crash. Although the cost of this recall was not material, and limited to a small number of total Model S&#146;s produced, we may experience additional recalls in the future, which could
adversely affect our brand in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, in January 2014
we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain Universal Mobile Connector NEMA 14-50 adapters, which are part of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves, potentially overheating during charging. We further
announced that we will provide upgraded NEMA 14-50 adapters to our customers as an additional safeguard. If such measures do not adequately address the underlying concerns, however, or if the public perceives such steps to be an indication of safety
concerns about the vehicles, our business, prospects and results of operations could be harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our electric vehicles may not perform
consistent with customers&#146; expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available. For example, our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles, and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles
currently on the market. Additionally, while Model S recently achieved an overall five star safety rating by NHTSA, such rating is not a guarantee of safe product design or that any individual vehicle will be free of any defect or failure.

2013. Even if we are able to continue to increase Model S production and sales, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable. In order to achieve profitability as well as long-term commercial success, we must continue to achieve our planned
cost reductions, control our operational costs while producing quality Model S vehicles, increase our Model S production rate, maintain strong demand for Model S in North America, and grow demand for Model S abroad in Europe and Asia. Failure to do

vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a pre-determined resale
value.&nbsp;As a result of this resale value guarantee and customers having the option of selling their vehicles to us, we apply lease accounting to such purchases, which defers the recognition of the associated revenues over time instead of full
recognition at vehicle delivery. During the first quarter of 2014, we provided the resale value guarantee to an additional 1,181 Model S deliveries and we expect the penetration rate to increase with the expansion of our financing programs in
additional states in the United States and in international markets. Although the resale value guarantee does not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery, a significant uptake under this program could have a significant
adverse impact on our near term GAAP revenues and operating results.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, while we do not assume any credit risk related to the
customer, we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles&#146; resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates, which could impact our future cash flows and/or profitability.
Currently, there is only a very limited secondary market for our electric vehicles in particular, and electric vehicles in general, on which to base our estimates, and such a secondary market may not develop in the future. Our residual value and
return volume estimates could prove to be incorrect, either of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. </P>

produce for other automobile manufacturers. While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs, we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited
flexibility in changing cell suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendors could disrupt production of Model S and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different
supplier is fully qualified. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our
raw materials or prices charged to us, such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased electric vehicle prices. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase Model S prices in response to increased raw material costs could be viewed negatively by our customers,

the Model S and our Supercharger network on a route from Washington, D.C. to Boston. Despite instructions to the contrary, the reporter did not follow all recommendations, including failing to fully recharge the vehicle at one of the two
Supercharger locations along the route. As a result, the Model S failed to complete the journey under its own power and the NY Times reporter published a negative review. While there were subsequent corrections by the NY Times Public Editor
regarding the reporter&#146;s failure to conform to all Tesla recommendations, as well as problems with &#147;precision and judgment,&#148; the original story still created a negative public perception about Model S, its capabilities and the

possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system. For example, we will not be able to utilize long-established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase our sales volume, which may harm our business, prospects,
financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we will be competing with companies with well-established distribution channels. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
have opened Tesla stores in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific Region, many of which have been open for only a short period of time. We have relatively limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our Tesla
stores, especially in Asia. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies. Implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenges, including
obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities, and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges. The concept and layout of our interactive stores, which are typically located in high profile retail centers, is different
than what has previously been used in automotive sales. We do not know whether our store strategy will continue to be successful. We may incur additional costs in order to improve or change our retail strategy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other aspects of our distribution model also differ from those used by traditional automobile manufacturers. For example, we do not anticipate
that we will ever carry a significant amount of Model S inventory at our stores and customers may need to wait up to a few months from the time they place an order until the time they receive their vehicle. This type of custom manufacturing is
unusual in the premium sedan market in the United States and it is unproven whether the average customer will be willing to wait this amount of time for such a vehicle. If customers do not embrace this ordering and retail experience, our business

liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other
future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. We self-insure against the risk of product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a
material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face

reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to
compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our cars or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at
the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile, which may
lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating results. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Volatility of demand in the automobile industry may
materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods.
For example, according to automotive industry sources, sales of passenger vehicles in North America during the fourth quarter of 2008 were over 30% lower than those during the same period in the prior year. Demand for automobile sales depends to a
large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more
established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we currently or will sell our electric vehicles, such as
Europe and Asia, will impact our business, prospects and operating results as well. Demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles, such as
sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and
increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively
smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to the seasonality
of our business, fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our operating results may vary significantly from
period-to-period due to many factors, including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles. Demand for new cars in the automobile industry typically declines over the winter season, while sales are generally
higher during the spring and summer months. Sales of the Tesla Roadster fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters.
We note that, in general, automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of Model&nbsp;S and future models may have similar seasonality. However, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to
judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. Also, any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for our vehicles. Our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent
with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition, we expect our period-to-period operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we, among other things, design, develop and manufacture Model X and future products,
increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facilities to produce vehicles at higher volumes, develop the Tesla Gigafactory, open new Tesla service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities, open new Supercharger locations, increase
our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results, especially in the
short-term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If any of this
occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are unable to establish
and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among consumers, analysts and within our industry, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and stock price may suffer materially. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support. If we were to cease or cut back operations, even years from
now, buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support. As a result, consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that
our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that
our business will succeed. If we are required to curtail our expansion plans in the future as we have done in the past, this may result in negative perceptions regarding our long-term business prospects and may lead to cancellations of Model S or
Model X orders and reservations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers,
suppliers, analysts and other parties in our liquidity and long-term business prospects. In contrast to some more established automakers, we believe that, in our case, the task of maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by
factors such as the following: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

our performance electric vehicles through our company-owned Tesla service centers, certain of our stores, and through our mobile service technicians known as the Tesla Rangers. However, certain service centers have been open for short periods, such
as those outside of the United States, and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles at these locations. We will need to open new standalone service centers in locations around the world and hire and train
significant numbers of new employees to staff these service centers and act as Tesla Rangers in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles. We only implemented our Tesla Rangers program in October 2009 and
have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers&#146; vehicles. There can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our
customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases. </P>

customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we do not adequately address our customers&#146; service needs, our brand and
reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Traditional automobile manufacturers in the United States do not provide maintenance and repair services directly. Consumers must rather
service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. We do not have any such arrangements with third party service providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service
providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles. At this point, we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future. As our vehicles are placed in more
locations, we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative
publicity and reduced sales, thereby harming our business and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the motor vehicle industry laws in many states
require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the state. Whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to
consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain. While we believe our Tesla Ranger program and our practice of shipping customers&#146; vehicles to our nearest Tesla store for service would satisfy regulators in these
circumstances, without seeking formal regulatory guidance, there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states. Further, certain state franchise laws which prohibit
manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from providing vehicle service. If issues arise in connection with these laws, certain aspects of Tesla&#146;s service program would need
to be restructured to comply with state law, which may harm our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening the

maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the Model S, Model X, Gen III and other future planned electric vehicles, and sell our electric powertrain components. If we do not continue to establish,
maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and
repair services, and we have very limited experience in these areas. Any problems associated with the Toyota RAV4 EV that uses a Tesla powertrain, the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV that will use a Tesla powertrain or the Model X may hurt the Tesla brand.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we expect that our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of
our marketing efforts. To date, we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet, word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand. To further promote our brand, we may be
required to change our marketing practices, which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses, including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we
may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in Detroit, Japan and the European Union, have greater name recognition,
broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong brand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.

depreciates significantly against these currencies (especially against the Japanese yen), our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. As a result, our operating
results could be adversely affected. As we dramatically increase Model S deliveries overseas during 2014 and beyond, as well as begin delivering powertrain units to Daimler, we may have greater revenues than costs denominated in other currencies, in

competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular. This could materially and adversely affect our growth as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, as our
growth depends, in part, on the availability and amounts of government incentives. For example, we currently benefit from certain exemptions in the United States, such as from California state sales and use taxes. Also, government programs have been
enacted in Europe favoring the purchase of electric vehicles, including disincentives that discourage the use of gas-powered vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on
non-recurring vehicle fees, or the 25% value added tax or other purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. In the event that such government programs are reduced or eliminated, or the available benefits thereunder are

contemplates customary obligations of us such as timely deliveries, warranty and product defect obligations. If we fail to meet these obligations, or if we exceed our current cost projections for producing these products, our profitability on this

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain. In certain instances, these
protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles. For example, we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most modes of vehicle operation. Our customers may become
accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle. However, when the vehicle is at maximum charge, the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed by the vehicle. Accordingly, our customers may
have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking. In addition, we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures. In such instances, the vehicle&#146;s acceleration and speed will
decrease. Finally, if the driver permits the battery pack to substantially deplete its charge, the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains. The vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a
stop. Despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge, the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected. There can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly, especially in these situations. Any accidents resulting
from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation, result in adverse publicity and product liability claims, and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating
results. In addition, if consumers dislike these features, they may choose not to buy additional cars from us, which could also harm our business and prospects. </P>

damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We previously experienced product recalls in May 2009,&nbsp;October 2010 and June 2013, none of which was related to our electric powertrain.
In April 2009, we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider. In October
2010, we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the
vehicle. In June 2013, we initiated a recall of slightly more than one thousand Model S vehicles to inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process. Rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat
backs in an upright position. Failure of this component may have resulted in collapse of the rear seat back during a crash. Finally, in January 2014, we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain Universal Mobile Connector NEMA
14-50 adapters, which are part of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves, potentially overheating during charging. In the future, we may at various times, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our
vehicles, including Model S, or our electric powertrain components prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. For example, in November 2013 NHTSA initiated a preliminary evaluation with respect to
two recent incidents in which Model S vehicles collided with road debris at highway speeds. Although we believe that NHTSA should close the preliminary evaluation without a finding of defect, it is possible that NHTSA could find that there is a
defect and order Model S to be recalled. Such recalls, voluntary or involuntary, involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets, as well as our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to

Roadster, which we extended to four years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase Extended Service plans for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty
for the Tesla Roadster to cover additional services for up to an additional three years or 36,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. Subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and
battery, we provide a four year or 50,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty for the purchasers of Model S. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Model S covers the battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, depending on
the size of the vehicle&#146;s battery, although the battery&#146;s charging capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or any Extended Service plan. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service

Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We record and adjust warranty reserves based on
changes in estimated costs and actual warranty costs. For new vehicles in particular, we record warranty reserves based on management&#146;s best estimate of projected warranty experience until adequate historical data is accumulated over a period
of time, generally a few quarters. As we have limited operating experience with Model S, and therefore little experience with warranty claims for this vehicle, reserves that we recorded for Model&nbsp;S may be insufficient to cover all future
warranty claims. Additionally, in 2013, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the customer ownership experience, we expanded the battery pack warranty and also eliminated the annual service requirement that was needed to keep the New Vehicle
Limited Warranty in effect. Should this change in warranty coverage lead to an increase in warranty claims, we may need to record additional warranty reserves which would negatively affect our profitability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since we began initiating sales of our vehicles, we have continued to refine our warranty reserves based on our actual warranty claim
experience and we may be required to undertake further changes in the future. As of March&nbsp;31, 2014, we had warranty reserves of $72.0 million, and such reserve amount will increase significantly in the future as our product offerings and sales
grow. We could in the future become subject to a significant and unexpected warranty expense. There can be no assurances that our currently existing or future warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims due to potential higher average
warranty expenses over the product life cycle or that our limited experience with warranty claims will adequately address the needs of our customers to their satisfaction. </P>

or generated by the vehicle, such as its current geographical position, previous and stored destination address history and web browser &#147;favorites.&#148;&nbsp;Any such unauthorized control of vehicles or access to or loss of information could
result in legal claims or proceedings and negative publicity, which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P>

currently expect that our battery pack for the Tesla Roadster will retain approximately 70% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will
result in a decrease to the vehicle&#146;s initial range and power. Deterioration of the Model S battery pack is expected to be less than the Roadster, however, such battery pack deterioration and the related decrease in range and power over time as
well as any perceived deterioration or fluctuation in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles, which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles. </P>

flows, if the costs for developing and manufacturing Model&nbsp;X exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses or embark on or accelerate new significant strategic investments, such as the Tesla Gigafactory, we may need
to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. This capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations, continue research and
development projects, including those for our planned Model X crossover and Gen III vehicle, establish sales and service centers, build and deploy Superchargers and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce
Model X. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects

United States.&nbsp;The profitability of the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual values, secure adequate financing to fund and grow this program, and manage customer credit risk.&nbsp;If actual residual values of
Model S vehicles are below our estimates, we may suffer lower profitability or potentially have losses. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with either internal funds or external financing sources, we may be unable to grow our
sales. Additionally, if we do not properly screen customers for ability to pay their leases on time, we may be exposed to excessive credit risks and associated losses. Furthermore, while our leasing program is currently limited in scope and financed
with our own funds, if our leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth. Finally, if we do not successfully monitor and comply
with federal and state regulations governing lease transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties, either of which may harm our business.</P>

dealer licenses, we have worked with state regulators to open galleries, which are locations where potential customers can view our vehicles but are not full retail locations. It is possible that a state regulator could later determine that the

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is
largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws and is being determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct
other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and largely
untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, the manner in which the applicable
authorities are applying their state laws to our distribution model continues to be difficult to predict. Laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with
applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. For example, in October 2012, vehicle dealer associations in New York and Massachusetts filed lawsuits to revoke the dealer license issued to Tesla Motors New York in New York and to limit the business
activity of Tesla Motors MA, Inc. in Massachusetts. These lawsuits have been dismissed, reinforcing our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. A similar litigation was recently filed in the state of
Ohio. Possible additional challenges in other states, if successful, could restrict or prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states. In some states, there have also been legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to
propose bills that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are
also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in Canada, Australia, and Japan, and have obtained licenses to sell vehicles in other places such as Hong Kong and China. Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the
principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in
jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult
to interpret and may change over time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles could materially and adversely affect our

rules and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued U.S. patents will result in issued patents in those foreign jurisdictions. Furthermore, even if these
patent applications do result in issued patents, some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the United States. In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and
others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P>

this loan. </P>

and are secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr.&nbsp;Musk and the Trust and other shares of capital stock of unrelated entities owned by Mr.&nbsp;Musk and the Trust. The terms of these loans were negotiated

Mr.&nbsp;Musk may be forced by Goldman Sachs Bank USA and/or Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of Tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the
terms of his loans. The loans between Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC on the one hand, and Mr.&nbsp;Musk and the Trust on the other hand, prohibit the non-pledged shares currently owned by Mr.&nbsp;Musk and the Trust from
being pledged to secure any other loans. These factors may limit Mr.&nbsp;Musk&#146;s ability to either pledge additional shares of Tesla common stock or sell shares of Tesla common stock as a means to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to
his pledged Tesla common stock in the event of a decline in our stock price that is large enough to trigger a margin call. Any sales of common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied may cause the price of our common stock to decline
