 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tesla Motors, Inc. (Tesla, we, us or our) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July&nbsp;1, 2003. We design,
develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America, Europe and Asia.&nbsp;The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to
market, manufacture, sell and/or service our vehicles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Public Offerings </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due March 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion
principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due March 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. In connection with the issuance of these 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions for which we paid an
aggregate $524.7&nbsp;million. In addition, we sold warrants and received aggregate proceeds of approximately $338.4 million from the sale of the warrants. Taken together, we received total cash proceeds of approximately $1.78 billion, net of
underwriting discounts and offering costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes
and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. In connection with the issuance of these additional notes, we entered
into convertible note hedge transactions and paid an aggregate $78.7&nbsp;million. In addition, we sold warrants and received aggregate proceeds of approximately $50.8 million from the sale of the warrants. Taken together, we received total cash
proceeds of approximately $267.6 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs (see Note 6). </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Use of Estimates </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period,

the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013 and other information disclosed in the related notes are
unaudited.&nbsp;The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements at that date.&nbsp;The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </P>

2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting update which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The new guidance provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Revenue Recognition </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize
revenues from sales of Model S and the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits, such as zero emission vehicle and greenhouse gas emission credits, as well as sales of electric
vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units. We recognize revenue when: (i)&nbsp;persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii)&nbsp;delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer
acceptance; (iii)&nbsp;fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv)&nbsp;collection is reasonably assured. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For Model S sales, revenue is
generally recognized when all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers. In certain circumstances, we may deliver a vehicle to a customer without all of the options ordered by the customer, provided that such options do not
limit the functionality of the vehicle. In such cases, we continue to defer the related revenue based on the undelivered items&#146; fair value, as evidenced by the contractual price of the option in stand-alone transactions, where available, or
using the selling price hierarchy where such prices do not exist. Additionally, if a customer purchases a vehicle option that requires us to provide services in the future, we defer the related revenue based on the undelivered items&#146; fair value
and recognize the associated revenue over our expected performance period. As of September&nbsp;30, 2014, we had deferred $37.6 million, $21.9 million and $9.1 million related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and service plans, access to our
Supercharger network and Model S connectivity, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had deferred $27.6 million, $10.3 million and $0.7 million related to these same performance obligations, respectively. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2014, we began offering a leasing program to qualified small and medium-sized businesses in the United States and Canada for Model S.
Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a Model S for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as
operating leases and accordingly, we recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term of the individual leases and record cost of automotive sales equal to the depreciation of the leased vehicles. As of September&nbsp;30, 2014, we had deferred
$4.5 million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded in automotive sales and for the three and nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2014, we recognized $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Resale Value Guarantee </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We offer a resale value guarantee or similar buy-back terms to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and who financed
their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a pre-determined resale value.
Although we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery, we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases. </P>

California.&nbsp;We concluded that based on our facts and circumstances, the lease meets the criteria for treatment as a build-to-suit lease arrangement. Accordingly, upon the commencement of our construction activities, we recorded construction in
progress and a corresponding financing liability of $19.2 million related to this facility. Depreciation of construction in progress begins when the assets are ready for their intended use. Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during
the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in progress is included in property, plant and equipment, and is amortized over the life of the related assets. During the three and nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2014, we capitalized $3.7 million and $6.9 million of interest expense, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, we capitalized $0.4 million and $2.3 million of interest expense, respectively.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable
inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.
Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of our common stock warrant liability,
which expired in May 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised primarily of money market funds,
are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices for similar securities. Our restricted short-term marketable securities are classified within Level II of the fair value
hierarchy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of September&nbsp;30, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013, the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets that are carried

repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.&nbsp;In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder
who elects to convert their notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. During the third quarter of 2014, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2019
Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of September&nbsp;30, 2014. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021
Notes are not convertible during the fourth quarter of 2014 and are classified as long-term debt. Should the closing price conditions be met in the fourth quarter of 2014 or a future quarter, the Notes will be convertible at their holders&#146;
option during the immediately following quarter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and

equity.&nbsp;The resulting debt discounts on the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.89% and 5.96%, respectively, over the contractual terms of the notes.&nbsp;During the three and
nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014, we recognized $19.6 million and $44.1 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount.&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;30, 2014, the net carrying value of 2019 Notes

$359.87 per share.&nbsp;The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $524.7&nbsp;million.&nbsp;In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for
certain specified events) a total of approximately 2.2&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 for the 2019 Notes and a total of approximately 3.3&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for 2021
Notes. We received $338.4&nbsp;million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants.&nbsp;Similarly, in connection with the issuance of additional notes in April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and paid an aggregate
$78.7&nbsp;million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 0.3&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a strike price of $512.66 per share for the warrants relating

the warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $359.87 to

B-Class electric vehicle. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we entered into a development agreement to assist Daimler with the development of a full electric powertrain for a Daimler Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV vehicle. Pursuant to the development
agreement, Daimler will pay us up to $33.2 million for the successful completion of certain at risk development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples. During the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014, we completed the final
development milestone, delivered prototype samples and recognized $2.8 million and $5.6 million in development services revenue, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, we completed various milestones, delivered
prototype samples and recognized $1.2 million and $11.3 million in development services revenue, respectively, related to the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV program. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility located in Fremont, California from New United
Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). NUMMI has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont site which could affect soil and groundwater, and until recently, were undertaking efforts to address these conditions. These conditions

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
are now being addressed by us and NUMMI. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has documented and managed the environmental issues and we completed a reasonable level of diligence on
such environmental issues at the time we purchased the facility, we cannot determine the potential costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination with any certainty. Based on management&#146;s best estimate, at the time of the facility purchase,
we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $5.3 million. The fair value of these liabilities was determined based on an expected value analysis of the related potential costs to investigate, remediate and
manage various environmental conditions that were identified as part of NUMMI&#146;s facility decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence efforts. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any
governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions, and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such
remediation activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement, subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth
anniversary date of the closing. Through September&nbsp;30, 2014, remediation costs of $3.1 million had been incurred by NUMMI. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the
ten-year anniversary of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has been spent on the remediation activities, whichever comes first, NUMMI&#146;s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all
environmental conditions at the Fremont site. At that point in time, we have agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability and we have released NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for NUMMI&#146;s obligations for
representations and warranties under the agreement. As of September&nbsp;30, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013, we accrued a total of $7.0 million and $5.5 million related to these environmental liabilities, respectively. As we continue with our
construction and operating activities, actual costs may differ materially from our estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Other Commitments and Contingencies

addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material
adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2013, a putative securities
class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The
complaint, made claims against Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney&#146;s fees on the basis of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr.&nbsp;Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions, including
with respect to the safety of Model S. This case was brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla&#146;s securities between August&nbsp;19, 2013 and November&nbsp;17, 2013. On September&nbsp;26, 2014, the
trial court, upon the motion of Tesla and Mr.&nbsp;Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and indicated that a formal written order will be forthcoming. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview and Quarter Highlights </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We are currently producing and selling our second vehicle, the Model S sedan. Model S is a four door, five-passenger
premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. The Model S inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster. We commenced deliveries of Model S
in June 2012 and have delivered approximately 47,000 vehicles through September&nbsp;30, 2014. We recently announced the availability of our Dual Motor Model S and intend to start delivering these vehicles to customers, starting with a
performance-optimized version, in December 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are continuing to develop our Model X crossover vehicle and currently intend to
commence customer deliveries in the third quarter of 2015. After the Model X, our goal is to introduce the Model 3, a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market, in 2017. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network which we are continuing to grow globally. We are also continuing to build a
network of Superchargers in the United States, Europe and Asia to allow Model S owners to have the ability to travel long distances without a limitation on range by charging their cars at a very fast rate for free. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014, we recognized total revenues of $851.8 million, an increase of $420.5 million over
total revenues of $431.3 million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013. This growth in revenues was primarily driven by growth of Model S deliveries worldwide, including in Europe and China, an increase in regulatory credit sales, and
an increase in powertrain sales to Daimler AG (Daimler) for the Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gross margin for the three months
ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 was 29.6%, an increase from 24.5% for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013. Higher regulatory credit sales, higher vehicle production volume, supply chain efficiencies and component cost reductions, partially
offset by one-time manufacturing inefficiencies associated with transitioning to our new final assembly line, contributed to the year-over-year increase in gross margin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 were $135.9 million, an increase from $56.4
million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013. R&amp;D expenses in the third quarter of 2013 included activities to develop the right hand drive version of Model S as well as to homologate Model S for markets outside of North America.
Higher R&amp;D expenses in the third quarter of 2014 reflected our accelerated engineering work on Model X as well as development work on our dual motor powertrain and on other programs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During 2013, we significantly increased our sales and service footprint both in North America and Europe, as well as accelerated the roll-out
of our Supercharging network. With the continued global expansion of our customer support infrastructure and the business in general in 2014, selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $155.1 million for the three months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2014, compared to $77.1 million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We ended the quarter with $2.39
billion in cash and cash equivalents and current restricted cash and short-term marketable securities, which was a significant increase from cash of $848.9 million held at the end of 2013. This increase was primarily driven by our issuance of an
aggregate of $2.30 billion of convertible senior notes in 2014. In connection with the issuance of these notes, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. For more information on the notes,

convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, see Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under Item&nbsp;1. Financial
Information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities
will provide us adequate liquidity based on our current plans. However, if market conditions are favorable, we may evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2014, we revealed our dual motor all-wheel drive version of Model S and our Autopilot system. These announcements have significantly
increased our weekly Model S order rate. Based on net orders since that announcement, excluding the extraordinary initial demand peak, we are confident of a 50% increase in both net orders and deliveries for Model S alone in 2015. Moreover, we
expect that demand for Model S will continue to increase worldwide as we grow our customer support infrastructure and continue to broaden the appeal of our products, and as consumer awareness improves. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to meet this anticipated demand, and to prepare for Model X anticipated demand, we are executing a plan to increase our combined
Model S and Model X production capacity to over 2,000 units per week by the end of 2015. In August 2014, we began our production ramp by transitioning to our new final assembly line and upgrading our body center. We are planning further investments
in production capacity during 2015, including upgrading our paint shop and building a new body shop for Model X. We expect our annual production will increase by over 50% each year for the next several years. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our recent production capacity expansion contributed to a production week of over 1,000 vehicles near the end of the third quarter of 2014.
However, the ramp to our target production rate took longer than expected due to system integration challenges, reducing our production by almost 2,000 vehicles during the third quarter. Despite entering the fourth quarter with this production
deficit, we still expect to produce about 35,000 cars for 2014. However, the loss of these cars in the third quarter means fewer available to deliver in the fourth quarter and our ability to ramp up production in the fourth quarter is constrained by
the complexity of launches related to dual motor and autopilot hardware. Consequently, we expect to be able to deliver only about 33,000 vehicles in 2014, which is 50% above 2013 deliveries but 5 &#150; 7% lower than our prior estimates for 2014.
Any unexpected issues with the continued ramp of our production line or the launch of Dual Motor Model S could affect our ability to achieve these revised delivery targets. One of the significant actions we intend to take in order to reduce
manufacturing complexity is simplify our product offering by reducing options and powertrain combinations. We believe this will enhance our ability to scale production in 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through the first half of 2013, we had delivered Model S vehicles solely to customers in North America. In August 2013, we started European
deliveries of Model S and in April 2014, we commenced deliveries into Asia, starting in China. Based on our current projections, we expect our long-term sales outside of North America will increase to almost half of our worldwide automotive sales.
We will continue to price Model S in markets outside of the United States the same as the price for Model S in the United States, with the addition of only unavoidable taxes, customs duties and transportation costs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to expand in China as quickly as possible because we believe that the country could be one of our largest markets within a few years.
In addition to increased deliveries into China, we have recently commenced deliveries in Japan and Hong Kong. As compared to markets in the United States and Europe, we have relatively limited experience in Asian markets; thus, we may face
difficulties meeting our future delivery plans in Asia. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model
S in the United States and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We introduced this program in Canada in October 2013 and into certain European markets in October 2014. Under the program, Model S customers
have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a pre-determined resale value. In certain markets, we also offer buy back guarantees to financial institutions which obligate us to
repurchase, and the institution to sell us, the vehicles for a pre-determined price. We account for these transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we defer and amortize to automotive sales revenue the initial purchase consideration less
guaranteed repurchase amount on a straight-line basis, over the contractual term of the guarantee program. Similarly, we capitalize and depreciate the cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of automotive
sales over the same period. If a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term, the amount of the resale value guarantee and operating lease vehicle net book value are then recognized in
automotive sales and cost of automotive sales, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The resale value guarantee amount represents management&#146;s best estimate
as to the resale value of the Model S vehicle and related vehicle options during the 36 to 39 month period after delivery. We are depreciating our operating lease vehicles to expected salvage value of our operating lease vehicles at the end of their
economic useful life (i.e., the end of their expected operating lease term), and we will adjust our depreciation estimates as needed if the expected salvage value decreases in future periods. As we accumulate more actual data related to the resale
experience of Model S, we may be required to make significant changes to our estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the third quarter of 2013, we provided the
resale value guarantee to 1,877 Model S deliveries in North America and to 1,190 Model S deliveries during the third quarter of 2014. To date, we have provided the resale value guarantee to approximately 8,800 customers in North America. Model S
deliveries with the resale value guarantee currently do not impact our cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program has adversely impacted our near-term revenues
and operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. Although lease accounting will continue to adversely impact our revenues and operating results as this and similar programs initially
ramp up, as time passes, the amortization of existing deferred revenues and costs will begin to partially offset this adverse impact. Furthermore, while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, we are exposed to the risk that the
vehicles&#146; resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could adversely impact our gross margin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2014, we launched Tesla Finance in the United States to offer leasing to small and medium-sized businesses. We expanded this program
to consumers in the United States in October 2014. Leasing through Tesla Finance is now available in 37 states, the District of Columbia and in 4 provinces of Canada. We leased 347 vehicles during the third quarter of 2014 and expect to increase our
leasing activities significantly during the rest of 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our U.S. leases are offered directly from Tesla as well as through a bank
partner. In both cases, leasing exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our near-term revenues and operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. In addition, for
leases offered directly from Tesla Finance (but not for those offered through our bank partner), we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We continue to evaluate a number of other customer financing products, either directly through Tesla Finance or indirectly through third party
financial institutions, as a way to better serve our growing customer base. If customer interest in these financing options is significant, we may be directly or indirectly subject to resale value risk for the Model S. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to sales of Model S, we recognize automotive sales from our supply of powertrain
systems to OEMs. During the second quarter of 2014, we began production deliveries to Daimler for the Mercedes-Benz B Class Electric Drive and continued these deliveries in the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, we substantially completed our
production and sales activities for the Toyota RAV4EV during the third quarter of 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Significant cost improvements for Model S were
achieved in 2013 and have continued in 2014, including part cost reductions as well as manufacturing efficiencies. We expect some of these trends to continue as we execute on our roadmap of achieving further component cost reductions and benefit
from economies of scale. In the third quarter of 2014, one-time manufacturing inefficiencies related to the transition to our new final assembly line increased the cost of all vehicles produced during the quarter and negatively impacted our gross
margin for the quarter. Moreover, as we expect to deliver about half of these vehicles within the fourth quarter, we expect a similar negative impact on our fourth quarter margins. We expect our automotive gross margin (excluding zero emission
vehicle (ZEV) credit sales) to increase from third quarter 2014 levels to greater than 28% by the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, as manufacturing efficiencies and part costs continue to improve. Factors weighing on the automotive gross margin
for the full quarter include delivery of vehicles built in Q3 with lower manufacturing efficiency and slightly lower average selling prices from weaker European currencies. Model S gross margin itself is generally higher than automotive gross
margin, which is moderately suppressed due to the significantly lower gross margin on powertrain sales. If we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives, our ability to reach
our gross margin goals would be negatively affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognized $129.8 million in ZEV credit sales in 2013 which contributed to our
gross margin. Although ZEV credit revenue was strong in 2013, over 90% of ZEV credit sales were recognized during the first half of 2013 with only $10.4 million recognized during the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013. During the three
months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014, we recognized $76.1 million in ZEV credit sales as a result of one-time contracts with various OEMs. Since we do not expect this level of activity in future quarters, we expect the contribution of ZEV credit
revenue to be lower in the future. While we will pursue opportunities to monetize ZEV credits we earn from the sale of our vehicles, we do not plan to rely on these sales to be a contributor to gross margin and our business model and financial plan
are not predicated on such ZEV credits. Other regulatory credit sales recognized during the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 were $16.7 million, compared to $14.8 million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S
platform. We continue to test the Alpha prototypes and are in the process of building the first Beta prototypes. We recently decided to build in significantly more validation testing time to achieve the best Model X possible. We also expect this
will enable a more rapid production ramp as compared to the production ramp for Model S in 2012. In anticipation of this effort, we now expect Model X deliveries to start in the third quarter of 2015. Our ability to launch the Model X program on
time and cost efficiently is dependent upon a variety of factors, including supplier readiness, engineering completion and the successful completion of our validation testing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to continue to expand our stores and service infrastructure in order to expand our geographical presence and to provide better service

continue to build service infrastructure in advance of demand to ensure that after-sale services are available when and where needed. For the remainder of 2014, the rate of location openings will
be fastest in Asia, followed by Europe, and then North America. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the end of May 2013, we announced the significant expansion of our
Supercharger network as well as plans to reduce charging time at our Superchargers. Since the time of our announcement, we have been installing Superchargers at an accelerating pace. We are continuing to expand our network in North America and have
increased our rate of deployment in Europe and Asia. If we experience difficulties in finding suitable sites, negotiating leases or obtaining required permits for such locations, our planned expansion of such Superchargers could be delayed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are developing the Tesla Gigafactory, a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor
material, cell, module and battery pack production in one location. In June 2014, we broke ground on the Gigafactory outside of Reno, Nevada. Construction continued during the third quarter of 2014 at an accelerated pace with first cells expected to
be produced in 2016 for use in Model S and Model X. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to use the battery packs manufactured at the Gigafactory for our vehicles,
initially for Model S and Model X, and later for our Model 3 vehicle, and stationary storage applications. The Gigafactory is currently expected to attain full production capacity in 2020, which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of
approximately 500,000 vehicles annually as well as stationary storage applications. By the time the Gigafactory reaches full, annualized production in 2020, we expect battery pack production capacity to reach 50 GWh. Of this, we expect to build 35
GWh of cell production capacity at the Gigafactory and purchase 15 GWh of cells from other manufacturers, potentially including Panasonic. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the Gigafactory will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs of greater than 30% on a per kWh
basis by the end of the first year of volume production of Model 3. The total capital expenditures associated with the Gigafactory through 2020 are expected to be $4-5 billion, of which approximately $2 billion is expected to come from Tesla. A
modular build strategy is enabling us to scale construction, capital requirements and capacity commensurate with growing demand. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While
our plan is to produce lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs at the Gigafactory, our plans for such production are at a very early stage. We have no experience in the production of lithium-ion cells, and accordingly we intend to engage
partners with significant experience in cell production. We recently formalized our agreement with Panasonic to partner on the Gigafactory. Panasonic will invest in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery
cells. We will prepare and provide the land, buildings and utilities for the Gigafactory, invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall management of the Gigafactory. Additional Gigafactory
partners will be finalized shortly to create a fully integrated industrial complex. Although planning discussions with production and supply chain partners continue to progress well, to date we have not formalized any agreements with any other
partners. In addition, the cost of building and operating the Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Operating expenses and capital expenditures have significantly increased in 2014 and will continue to do so as we continue to invest in the
long-term growth of the company. For the rest of 2014, we will continue to significantly expand production capacity for Model S and Model X, continue the construction of the Gigafactory, invest in our customer support infrastructure, continue the
development of Model X and start early design work on Model 3. Our R&amp;D expenses in particular are continuing to increase as design and engineering work accelerates on Model X and overall product development but is expected to decrease as a
percentage of revenue over time. R&amp;D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2014 are expected </P>

Notes. Under the terms of 2018 Notes, 1.50% coupon interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June&nbsp;1 and December&nbsp;1 of each year, commencing on December&nbsp;1, 2013. During the three and

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability and foreign exchange
gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Prior to the expiration of the DOE warrant in
May 2013, the DOE warrant had been carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other income (expense), net. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other expense, net, during the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 was $3.1 million, an increase from $0.7 million during the three

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other income, net, during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 was $2.4 million, a decrease from $18.0 million during the nine months
ended September&nbsp;30, 2013. In March 2013, we entered into a fourth amendment to the DOE Loan Facility which, among other things, accelerated the maturity date of our DOE loans to December&nbsp;15, 2017; therefore, the DOE warrant was no longer
expected to vest. We recorded the reduction in fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability of $10.7 million in other income, net, during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. Other income, net, during the nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013 was also attributable to the favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. </P>

increase during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 was due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions, following the commencement of European Model S deliveries in August 2013 and Model S

our revenues have been denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have materially greater revenues than expenses denominated in the Chinese yuan and Norwegian krona, and materially greater expenses than revenues denominated in the Japanese yen.
Accordingly, if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against currencies where expenses exceed revenues, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase which may adversely impact our
operating results. Conversely, as the value of the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against currencies where revenues exceed expenses, our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars may be reduced. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California,
alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint, which made claims against Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney&#146;s fees
on the basis of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr.&nbsp;Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions, including with respect to the safety of Model S. This case was brought on behalf of a putative class consisting
of certain persons who purchased Tesla&#146;s securities between August&nbsp;19, 2013 and November&nbsp;17, 2013. On September&nbsp;26, 2014, the trial court, upon the motion of Tesla and Mr.&nbsp;Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and

significantly increased production and deliveries, and our plans call for an even greater increase in production and deliveries going forward. As part of this effort, we recently completed a new final assembly line and added more automation to our
body shop at the Fremont factory. Our ability to further ramp-up high volume Model S production, including for the Dual Motor Model S, which we will soon begin producing for the first time, will depend upon a number of factors, including our ability
to use these new manufacturing processes as planned while maintaining our desired quality levels, our suppliers&#146; ability to deliver quality parts to us in a timely manner, and efficiently making design changes to ensure consistently high
quality. The Model S is an all new vehicle which we are producing with new employees using new equipment and therefore our production processes are still maturing and we have limited experience with them. To produce a vehicle that meets our quality
standards requires us to carefully analyze each step of our production plan, improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue to train our employees. Our suppliers also must produce new products in sufficient quantities and quality
to meet our demand. Certain suppliers have experienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements, and we continue to focus on supplier capabilities and constraints. Any disruption in increasing
our production level of Model S in line with our plans could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, for Model S we have introduced a number of new manufacturing technologies and
techniques, such as aluminum spot welding systems, which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry; and the Model S has a number of new and unique design features, such as a 17 inch display screen, retractable exterior door handles,
and all-new dual motor and autopilot hardware, each of which poses unique manufacturing challenges. Model S production and deliveries will continue to require significant resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could
harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity for Model S, or cause us to miss planned production targets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Additionally, sustaining high
volume production and doing so in a manner that avoids significant cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, may be difficult. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrent with the significant increase in our planned production levels, we will also need to continue to significantly increase our
deliveries of Model S vehicles. We have limited experience in delivering a high volume of Model S vehicles, and, in particular, to locations outside of the United States We may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans in Asia and the
right hand drive markets we have entered and will enter later this year, which may impact our ability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals. If we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goals globally to match our production rate of Model S,
this could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our long-term success is dependent on market acceptance of the Model S sedan and future electric vehicles we introduce. In the United States,
there is no guarantee that Model S will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public, especially in the long-term. As we expand in Europe and Asia, there is no guarantee that customers in these markets will embrace our vehicles and if
they do not, demand for our vehicles could be lower than our expectations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
design future electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models, including the Model X crossover, will become commercially viable. To date, we have publicly revealed only an early prototype of the Model X.
Work continues on the finalization of Model X with the testing of Alpha prototypes and initial builds of the first Beta prototypes. To the extent that we are not able to build Model X in accordance with the expectations created by the early
prototype and our announced specifications and schedule, customers may cancel their reservations, our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose confidence in us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we have also announced our intent to develop Model 3 which we expect to produce at the Tesla Factory after the introduction of
Model X. We intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our Model S. Importantly, we anticipate producing Model 3 for the mass market and thus we will need a high-volume supply of lithium-ion
cells at reasonable prices. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we intend each of our production vehicles and their variants to meet a distinct segment of the
automotive market, our vehicles may end up competing with each other which may delay sales and associated revenue to future periods. Also, if we fail to accurately anticipate demand for each of our vehicles, this could result in inefficient
expenditures and production delays. Furthermore, historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, we may be required to introduce on a regular
basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As automotive technologies change, including those specific to electric vehicles, we anticipate our customers will expect us to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and
introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology. To date, we have limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling our electric vehicles as well as limited
experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple vehicles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may experience significant

financial condition and operating results. Automobile manufacturers often experience delays in the design, manufacture and commercial release of new vehicle models. We experienced significant
delays in launching the Tesla Roadster, which resulted in additional costs and adverse publicity for our business. In 2012, we also experienced delays in the ramp of Model S. We may experience further delays in launching Model X which may result in
cost overruns and adverse publicity. Work continues on the finalization of Model X with the testing of Alpha prototypes and initial builds of the first Beta prototypes. Furthermore, we have not yet evaluated, qualified or selected all of our
suppliers for the planned production of Model X. We may not be able to engage suppliers for the components in a timely manner, at an acceptable price or in the necessary quantities. We will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that Model X is
in compliance with applicable NHTSA safety regulations and obtain EPA and CARB certification to emission regulations prior to beginning volume production and delivery of the vehicles. If we are not able to manufacture and deliver Model X or future
vehicles such as Model 3 in a timely manner and consistent with our production timeline, budget and cost projections, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business

integrate the production of lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs for our vehicles at our new Gigafactory. Our Gigafactory plan, however is at an early stage. While we recently entered into various formal agreements with Panasonic on the
Gigafactory, we have very little experience in building a factory of the size and scope planned for the Gigafactory, and no experience directly in the production of lithium-ion cells. In addition, to date we have not finalized agreements with
additional Gigafactory partners that will be co-located at the Gigafactory. Also, the cost of building and operating the Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate. If we
are unable to build the Gigafactory in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells at reasonable prices, then our ability to supply battery packs to our vehicles, including Model 3, according to our schedule and/or at a
price that allows us to sell them profitably and in the quantities we estimate could be constrained. Any such problems or delays with Gigafactory could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating

such as the Toyota RAV4 EV or the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. For example, our vehicles are highly dependent on software to
operate. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced, and changes to software may have unexpected effects. Model S issues experienced by customers include those related to the software for the

were unrelated to our electric powertrain. In May 2009, we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a
missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider, which is the partially assembled Tesla Roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall for some of our Tesla Roadsters after
the 12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. In June 2013, we initiated a recall
of slightly more than a thousand Model S vehicles to inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process. Rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in an upright position. Failure of this
component may have resulted in the collapse of the rear seat back during a crash. Although the cost of this recall was not material, and limited to a small number of total Model S&#146;s produced, we may experience additional recalls in the future,
which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, in
January 2014 we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain Universal Mobile Connector NEMA 14-50 adapters, which are part of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves, potentially overheating during charging.
We further announced that we would provide upgraded NEMA 14-50 adapters to our customers as an additional safeguard. If such measures do not adequately address the underlying concerns, our business, prospects and results of operations could be
harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our electric vehicles may not perform consistent with customers&#146; expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently
available. For example, our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles, and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the market. Additionally, while Model S recently achieved an overall five
star safety rating by NHTSA, there is no guarantee that future model years or variants or other Tesla vehicles will also attain such safety ratings, and any such rating is not a guarantee of safe product design or that any individual vehicle will be
free of any defect or failure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any product defects or any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could

the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from single sources. To date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we do not maintain long-term agreements with a number
of our suppliers. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain
or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term, or at all, at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate
sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be time consuming, costly
and may force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle&#146;s design. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources
of delivery failure or component shortages for Model S, as well as for our powertrain component sales activities. For example, earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in Japan in March 2011 could negatively impact our supply chain. We have in
the past experienced source disruptions in our supply chains, including those relating to our slower-than-anticipated ramp in our Model S production goals for 2012. We may experience additional delays in the future with respect to Model S and any
other future vehicle we may produce. In addition, because we have written agreements in place with the majority, but not all, of our suppliers, this may create uncertainty regarding certain suppliers&#146; obligations to us, including but not
limited to, those regarding warranty and product liability. Changes in business conditions, wars, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers&#146; ability to
deliver components to us on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we experience significantly increased demand, or need to replace certain existing suppliers, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when
required on terms that are favorable to us, at all, or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. In the past, we have replaced certain suppliers because of
their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards. The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our
customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost and delay. We have also experienced
cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made, and we may experience similar cost increases in the future. Additionally, we are negotiating
with existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them cheaper to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier
costs, our operating results will suffer. Additionally, cost reduction efforts may interrupt or harm our normal production processes, thereby harming Model S quality or reducing Model S production output. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, a failure by our suppliers to provide the components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our
performance electric vehicles such as Model S could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, in October 2013, we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with Panasonic

need to expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate, train or

for Model S were high initially due to start-up costs at the Tesla Factory, manufacturing inefficiencies including low absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, higher logistics costs due to the immaturity of our supply chain, and higher initial
prices for component parts during the initial period after the launch and ramp of Model S. As we have gradually ramped production of Model S, manufacturing costs per vehicle have decreased. While we expect further cost reductions to be realized by
both us and our suppliers during the next several quarters, there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our high-performance electric cars, assembling
vehicles and compensating our personnel. We may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of Model S and powertrain manufacturing facilities and the recent launch in Asia. Furthermore, if we are unable to
produce Model X pursuant to our plan due to cost overruns or other unexpected costs, we may not be able to meet our gross margin targets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control. For example, the costs of our raw materials and
components, such as lithium-ion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels, could increase due to shortages as global demand for these products increases. Indeed, if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without
significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology, shortages could occur which would result in increased material costs to us or potentially limit our ability to expand production. Additionally, we
may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our vehicles, including through the use of traditional media such as television, radio and print, even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited as
we have to date relied upon unconventional marketing efforts. If we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed. </P>

lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. Extremely rare incidents of laptop computers, cell phones and electric vehicle
battery packs catching fire have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These events have raised concerns about the
batteries used in automotive applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. We have designed the battery pack to passively
contain any single cell&#146;s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells. However, we have delivered only a limited number of our vehicles to customers and have limited field experience with them. We have also only delivered a limited
number of battery packs to Toyota and Daimler. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or
death and may subject us to lawsuits. We may have to recall our vehicles or participate in a recall of a vehicle that contains our battery packs, and redesign our battery packs, which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public
perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve us, could seriously harm our business.

must continue to achieve our planned cost reductions, control our operational costs while producing quality vehicles, increase our production rate, maintain strong demand in North America, and grow demand abroad in Europe and Asia. Failure to do one
or more of these things could prevent us from achieving sustained, long-term profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The introduction of our resale value

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and Canada and financed their
vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. In April and October of 2014, we started offering leasing to business customers and individual customers, respectively, including through Tesla Finance, our captive finance company.
Both the resale value guarantee program and leasing offered through Tesla Finance lower our revenues as compared to cash purchases and both expose us to the risk that any vehicles repurchased or returned to us under the programs may be resold by us
for prices less than we estimate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the resale value guarantee program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle
back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a pre-determined resale value.&nbsp;As a result of this resale value guarantee and customers having the option of selling their vehicles to us, we apply lease accounting to such
purchases, which defers the recognition of the associated revenues over time instead of full recognition at vehicle delivery. Although the resale value guarantee does not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery, a
significant uptake under this program could have a significant adverse impact on our near term GAAP revenues and operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under
the leasing program offered through Tesla Finance, we lease vehicles directly to customers. Customers have the option of purchasing their vehicles at the stated value in the leasing contract or returning their vehicles to us. We apply lease
accounting to such purchases. Unlike the resale value guarantee program, we may receive only a very small portion of the price of the vehicle from our customers at the time of purchase, and instead will receive a stream of lease payments. To the
extent we expand this program and are unable to secure appropriate financing, our cash flow and liquidity, as well as our near term GAAP revenues and operating results, could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, we are exposed to the risk that
customers fail to pay their lease payments on time and according to the terms of our leasing contracts. </P>

than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates, which could impact our future cash flows and/or profitability. Currently, there is only a very limited secondary market for our electric vehicles in
particular, and electric vehicles in general, on which to base our estimates, and such a secondary market may not develop in the future. Our residual value and return volume estimates could prove to be incorrect, either of which could harm our

produce for other automobile manufacturers. While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs, we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited
flexibility in changing cell suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendors could disrupt production of Model S and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different
supplier is fully qualified. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our
raw materials or prices charged to us, such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased electric vehicle prices. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase Model S or future vehicle prices in response to increased raw material costs could be viewed negatively by

not common in the automobile industry today, particularly in the United States. We plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicles in company-owned Tesla stores and over the internet. While we believe our approach is important to the
success of our technology and vehicles, this model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven, especially in the United States, and subjects us to substantial risk as it requires, in the aggregate, a significant expenditure and provides
for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system. For example, we do not utilize long-established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase
our sales volume, which may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we compete with companies with well-established distribution channels. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have opened Tesla stores in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific Region, many of which have been open for only a short period of
time. We have relatively limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our Tesla stores, especially in Asia. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and
marketing strategies. Implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenges, including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities, and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges. The concept
and layout of our interactive stores, which are typically located in high profile retail centers, is different than what has previously been used in automotive sales. We do not know whether our store strategy will continue to be successful. We may
incur additional costs in order to improve or change our retail strategy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other aspects of our distribution model also differ from those
used by traditional automobile manufacturers. For example, we do not anticipate that we will ever carry a significant amount of vehicle inventory at our stores and customers may need to wait up to a few months from the time they place an order until
the time they receive their vehicle. This type of custom manufacturing is unusual in the premium sedan market in the United States and it is unproven whether the average customer will be willing to wait this amount of time for such a vehicle. If
customers do not embrace this ordering and retail experience, our business will be harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may become subject to product

financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. These systems support our operations and enable us to produce Model S and future vehicles like Model X in volume. The implementation, maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant
management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement,

manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors introduced
the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery pack. </P>

Audi, are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also entered or announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign
countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Most of our current and potential
competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of
their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition
than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. Additionally, we have not in the past, and do not currently, offer
customary discounts on our vehicles like most of our competitors do. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in
light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing,
reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to
compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our cars or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at
the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile, which may

materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods.
For example, according to automotive industry sources, sales of passenger vehicles in North America during the fourth quarter of 2008 were over 30% lower than those during the same period in the prior year. Demand for automobile sales depends to a
large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more
established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we currently or will sell our electric vehicles, such as
Europe and Asia, will impact our business, prospects and operating results as well. Demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles, such as
sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, </P>

import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers. </P>

are highly technical products that require maintenance and support. If we were to cease or cut back operations, even years from now, buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and
obtaining satisfactory support. As a result, consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third
parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. If we are required to curtail our expansion plans in the future as we have done in the
past, this may result in negative perceptions regarding our long-term business prospects and may lead to cancellations of Model S or Model X orders and reservations. </P>

expectations regarding service, our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected. We have limited experience servicing our vehicles, especially in Europe and Asia. Servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles
with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques. If we are unable to satisfactorily service our customers and the various service related issues that they are facing and may
face in the future, our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional Model S vehicles could be impaired. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We service our performance electric vehicles through our company-owned Tesla service centers, certain of our stores, and through our mobile
service technicians known as the Tesla Rangers. However, certain service centers have been open for short periods, such as those outside of the United States, and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles at these
locations. We will need to open new standalone service centers in locations around the world and hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these service centers and act as Tesla Rangers in order to successfully maintain our fleet
of delivered performance electric vehicles. We only implemented our Tesla Rangers program in October 2009 and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers&#146; vehicles. There can be no assurance that these service
arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as
the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not expect to be able to open Tesla service centers in all the
geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside. In order to address the service needs of customers who are not in geographical proximity to our service centers, we plan to either transport those vehicles to the nearest
Tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile Tesla Rangers to service the vehicles at the customer&#146;s location. These special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these
services to our customers. In addition, a number of potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we do not adequately address our customers&#146; service needs, our brand
and reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Traditional automobile manufacturers in the United States do not provide maintenance and repair services directly. Consumers must rather
service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. We do not have any such arrangements with third party service providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service
providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles. At this point, we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future. As our vehicles are placed in more
locations, we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative
publicity and reduced sales, thereby harming our business and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the motor vehicle industry laws in many states
require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the state. Whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to
consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain. While we believe our Tesla Ranger program and our practice of transporting customers&#146; vehicles to our nearest Tesla service center would satisfy regulators in these
circumstances, without seeking formal regulatory guidance, there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states. Further, certain state franchise laws which prohibit

maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the Model S, Model X, Model 3 and other future planned electric vehicles, and sell our electric powertrain components. If we do not continue to establish,
maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and
repair services, and we have very limited experience in these areas. Any problems associated with the Toyota RAV4 EV and Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV, both of which use a Tesla powertrain, or the Model X may hurt the Tesla brand. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we expect that our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our
marketing efforts. To date, we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet, word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand. To further promote our brand, we may be required
to change our marketing practices, which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses, including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not
be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in Detroit, Japan and the European Union, have greater name recognition, broader
customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong brand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted. </P>

the driver such that airbag and other safety systems could be compromised. Other customers have changed wheels and tires, while others have installed large speaker systems that may impact the electrical systems of the vehicle. We have not tested,
nor do we endorse, such changes or products. In addition, customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets can expose our customers to injury from high voltage electricity. Such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety
of our vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could result in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P>

customer base of our electric vehicles, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular. This could materially and adversely
affect our growth as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, as our growth depends, in part, on the availability and amounts of government incentives. For example, we currently benefit from certain exemptions in
the United States, such as from California state sales and use taxes. Also, government programs have been enacted in Europe favoring the purchase of electric vehicles, including disincentives that discourage the use of gas-powered vehicles. In
Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees, or the 25% value added tax or other purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. In the event
that such government programs are reduced or eliminated, or the available benefits thereunder are exhausted earlier than anticipated, sales of electric vehicles, including our Model S, could be adversely affected. In addition, customers in certain
markets may delay taking delivery of their Tesla vehicles if they believe that certain EV incentives will be available at a later date, and this may negatively affect our ability to achieve our planned delivery targets. </P>

protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles. For example, we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most modes of vehicle operation. Our customers may become
accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle. However, when the vehicle is at maximum charge, the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed by the vehicle. Accordingly, our customers may
have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking. In addition, we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures. In such instances, the vehicle&#146;s acceleration and speed will
decrease. Finally, if the driver permits the battery pack to substantially deplete its charge, the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains. The vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a
stop. Despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge, the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There can be no assurance

NUMMI&#146;s liability to us with respect to Remediation Activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the Fremont site. At that point in time, we have agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from
all liability, including attorney fees, or any costs or penalties it may incur arising out of or in connection with any claim relating to environmental conditions and we have released NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for NUMMI&#146;s

historical or projected experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future. Subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery, we provide a four year or 50,000 mile New Vehicle Limited
Warranty for the purchasers of Model&nbsp;S. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Model&nbsp;S also covers the drive unit for eight years and the battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, depending on the size of the
vehicle&#146;s battery; although the battery&#146;s charging capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or any Extended Service plan. </P>

Model&nbsp;S are subject to certain limitations, exclusions or separate warranties, including certain wear items, such as tires, brake pads, paint and general appearance, and battery performance, and is intended to cover parts and labor to repair
defects in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems, powertrain and brake system. We have previously provided our Tesla Roadster customers with a battery replacement option to
replace the battery in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles. Additionally, in 2013, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the
customer ownership experience, we expanded the battery pack warranty and also eliminated the annual service requirement that was needed to keep the New Vehicle Limited Warranty in effect. Should this change in warranty coverage lead to an increase

matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles, and we cannot be certain that our
insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us.&nbsp;A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating
results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due fluctuations in our operating costs and the

develop the Gigafactory, open new Tesla service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities, open new Supercharger locations, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support our
growing operations. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results, especially in the short-term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of
future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time. </P>

operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue. </P>

electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns as well as other factors. How a customer uses their Tesla vehicle, the frequency of recharging the battery pack at a low state of charge and
the means of charging can result in additional deterioration of the battery pack&#146;s ability to hold a charge over the long term. For example, we currently expect that our battery pack for the Tesla Roadster will retain approximately 70% of its
ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle&#146;s initial range and power. Deterioration of the Model S battery pack is expected to be less than the Roadster,
however, such battery pack deterioration and the related decrease in range and power over time as well as any perceived deterioration or fluctuation in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles,

unplanned expenses or embark on or accelerate new significant strategic investments, such as the Gigafactory, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from
government or financial institutions. This capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations, continue research and development projects, including those for our planned Model X crossover and Model 3 vehicle, establish sales and service
centers, build and deploy Superchargers and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce Model X. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all.

actual residual values of Model S vehicles are below our estimates, we may suffer lower profitability or potentially have losses. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with either internal funds or external financing sources, we
may be unable to grow our sales. Additionally, if we do not properly screen customers for ability to pay their leases on time, we may be exposed to excessive credit risks and associated losses. Furthermore, if our leasing business grows
substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth. Finally, if we do not successfully monitor and comply with federal and state financial regulations and

Tesla stores as well as over the internet. We may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the United States as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents
of the state or to impose other limitations on this sales model, including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state. In
certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses, we have worked with state regulators to open galleries, which are locations where potential customers can view our vehicles but are not full retail locations. It is possible that a
state regulator could later determine that the activities at our gallery constitute unlicensed sales of motor vehicles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In many states,
the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws and is being determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical
presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits
manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and largely untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some
interpretation and discretion by the regulators, the manner in which the applicable authorities are applying their state laws to our distribution model continues to be difficult to predict. Laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain
dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell
vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. For example, in October 2012, vehicle dealer associations in New York and Massachusetts filed lawsuits to revoke the dealer
license issued to Tesla Motors New York in New York and to limit the business activity of Tesla Motors MA, Inc. in Massachusetts. These lawsuits have been dismissed, and in one recent court decision, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held that
state franchise laws like the one in Massachusetts do not restrict a manufacturer, like Tesla, that does not use franchised dealers from selling its vehicles directly to consumers. Such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws
were not designed to prevent our distribution model. A similar litigation was recently filed in the state of Ohio and subsequently dismissed. Possible additional challenges in other states, if successful, could restrict or prohibit our ability to
sell our vehicles to residents in such states. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills and regulations that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses
in their states given our current sales model. Such examples recently occurred in New Jersey, where the Motor Vehicle Commission, at the behest of the local automobile dealer lobby, passed a new regulation which purported to invalidate our sales
licenses in the state, and in Michigan, where the state&#146;s automobile dealer association managed to add language into an unrelated bill that had the effect of impairing our right to sell vehicles through Tesla stores in Michigan. We have brought
a lawsuit in New Jersey to invalidate that regulation, which we believe to be unlawful, and we are evaluating legislative and litigation solutions to remedy the situation in Michigan. Other states, such as New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, have
passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. </P>

Notes and together with the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, collectively, the Notes). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal when due, to make quarterly interest payments or to make payments upon conversion or to refinance the Notes,
depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations
under the Notes and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or
capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Notes or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial
condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the Notes or future indebtedness. </P>

following a securities offering. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company&#146;s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against
these companies. For example, a shareholder litigation like this was filed against us in 2013. While the trial court recently dismissed the plaintiffs&#146; complaint with prejudice, this litigation (if the trial court&#146;s order is successfully

have registered shares previously issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans and agreements, a portion of which are related to outstanding option awards. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and,
in certain cases, lock-up agreements, the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market. Sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to
