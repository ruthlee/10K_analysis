 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tesla Motors, Inc. (Tesla, we, us or our) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July&nbsp;1, 2003. We design,
develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America, Europe and Asia.&nbsp;The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to
market, sell and/or service our vehicles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Public Offerings and Concurrent Private Placements </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2013, we completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3,902,862 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of
approximately $355.5 million (which includes 487,857 shares or $45.0 million sold to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO)), net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. We also sold 596,272 shares of our common stock to our CEO and
received total cash proceeds of $55.0 million in a private placement at the public offering price. Concurrent with these equity transactions, we also issued $660.0 million principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due June 2018 (Notes) in a
public offering and received total cash proceeds of approximately $648.0 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs (see Note 6). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2012, we completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 7,964,601 shares of our common stock for total cash
proceeds of $222.1 million (which includes 35,398 shares or $1.0 million sold to our CEO), net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Restatement of Prior Year Amounts </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
conjunction with our Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March&nbsp;7, 2013, we restated the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows
for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012. Amounts related to purchases of property and equipment during the period that were not paid as of September&nbsp;30, 2012 were erroneously included as cash outflows from investing activities in our
previously issued financial statements. This correction resulted in a $22.6 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment included in cash flows used in investing activities and a corresponding increase in the change in accounts payable
resulting in an increase in cash flows used in operating activities. We also corrected our supplemental disclosure of noncash acquisition of property and equipment by an increase of $34.4 million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012.
There was no impact on our previously reported total cash and cash equivalents, condensed consolidated balance sheet or condensed consolidated statement of operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Use of Estimates </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period,
including revenue recognition, residual value of operating lease vehicles, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of financial instruments and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September&nbsp;30, 2013, the condensed consolidated statements of operations for
the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 and 2012, the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 and 2012 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash
flows for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 and 2012 and other information disclosed in the related notes are unaudited.&nbsp;The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 was derived from our audited consolidated
financial statements at that date.&nbsp;The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our Form&nbsp;10-K for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 filed with the SEC. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the
results of operations for the periods presented. The condensed consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future year or interim period.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Revenue Recognition </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize revenues from sales of Model S and the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of
regulatory credits, such as zero emission vehicle and greenhouse gas emission credits, as well as sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units. We recognize revenue when: (i)&nbsp;persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii)&nbsp;delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii)&nbsp;fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv)&nbsp;collection is reasonably assured. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For Model S sales, revenue is generally recognized when all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers. In certain
circumstances, we may deliver a vehicle to a customer without all of the options ordered by the customer, provided that such options do not limit the functionality of the vehicle. In such cases, we continue to defer the related revenue based on the
undelivered items&#146; fair value, as evidenced by the contractual price of the option in stand-alone transactions, where available, or using the selling price hierarchy where such prices do not exist. Additionally, if a customer purchases a
vehicle option that requires us to provide services in the future, we will defer the related revenue based on the undelivered items&#146; fair value and recognize the associated revenue over our expected performance period. As of September&nbsp;30,
2013, we had deferred $17.5 million related to the purchase of vehicle service plans and $7.2 million related to access to our Supercharger network. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Resale Value Guarantee </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and financed their
vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a pre-determined resale value.
Although we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery, we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases. Accordingly, we defer and amortize to automotive sales revenue the initial
purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straight-line basis, over the contractual term of the guarantee program. Similarly, we capitalize and depreciate the cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less resale value
guarantee amount to cost of automotive sales over the same period. If a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term, any unamortized deferred revenue and operating lease vehicle net book value
is then recognized in automotive sales and cost of automotive sales, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The resale value guarantee amount represents
management&#146;s best estimate as to the resale value of the Model S vehicle and related vehicle options during the 36 to 39 month period after delivery. Since we are depreciating our operating lease vehicles to the resale value guarantee amount,
we will adjust our depreciation estimates as needed, if the resale value is projected to be lower in future periods. As we accumulate more actual data related to the resale experience of Model S, we may be required to make significant changes to our
estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of September&nbsp;30, 2013, we recorded $160.8 million in deferred revenues and $159.0 million in resale value guarantee
related to Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee and recorded $262.8 million in operating lease vehicles, net. During the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, we recognized revenue of $9.4 million and $11.3 million in
automotive sales, and $5.9 million and $7.3 million in cost of automotive sales related to this program. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We began recording warranty reserves with the commencement of Tesla Roadster sales in 2008. Initially, Tesla Roadsters were sold with a
warranty of three years or 36,000 miles, which we extended to four years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. Tesla Roadster customers had the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of
the New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. In June 2012, we commenced deliveries of Model S. Model S is sold with a
warranty of four years or 50,000 miles for most vehicle components and which covers the battery pack for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, depending on the size of the vehicle&#146;s battery. Model S customers also have
the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional four years or 50,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a specified period of
time. The battery pack&#146;s charging capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or any Extended Service plan. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): </P>

based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data. For new vehicles, warranty reserves are based on management&#146;s best estimate of projected warranty experience
until adequate historical data is accumulated. Our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our resale value guarantee vehicles as such actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred. For the three and nine months
ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, warranty costs incurred for our resale value guarantee vehicles were $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. We may have material changes as we accumulate more actual data and experience. We review our reserves at
least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of
operations. The portion of the warranty provision which is expected to be incurred within 12 months from the balance sheet date is classified as current, while the remaining amount is classified as long-term. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair
value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in which
there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Our financial
assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents. Our liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of our common stock warrant liability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of
the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices for similar securities. Our common stock warrant liability (see Note 6) had been classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. </P>

deposits are generally not restricted as to their use by us. Upon delivery of the vehicle, the related customer deposits are applied against the customer&#146;s total purchase price for the vehicle and recognized in automotive sales as part of the
respective vehicle sale. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, we have referred to such customer deposits as reservation payments and these initial reservation
payments have been fully refundable until such time that the customer selected the vehicle specifications and entered into a purchase agreement. We have eliminated the reservation process for Model S in North America and in most of our markets in
Europe, as vehicle production became more reliable and customer wait times decreased. Customers now initiate their purchase by ordering their customized Model S rather than placing a generic reservation in queue. As a result of this transition away
from reservations, we have renamed the &#147;reservation payments&#148; caption on our condensed consolidated financial statements to &#147;customer deposits.&#148; </P>

trading day period; or (3)&nbsp;if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion, we would pay the holders in cash for the principal amount of the Notes and, if
applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a calculated daily conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date,
holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events
occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the
Notes from the host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option of $82.8 million in stockholders&#146; equity. The resulting debt discount on the Notes is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.29%
over the contractual term of the Notes. During the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, we recognized $3.8 million and $5.4 million of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount, respectively. As of
September&nbsp;30, 2013, the net carrying value of the Notes was $582.5 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered
into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase up to 5.3&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $124.52 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was
$177.5&nbsp;million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase up to approximately 5.3&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a price of $184.48 per share. We received $120.3&nbsp;million in
cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the Notes and to effectively increase the overall
conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders&#146; equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost
incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September&nbsp;30, 2013. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the third quarter of 2013, the closing price of our common stock met or exceeded 130% of
the applicable conversion price of our Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of the Notes may convert their Notes during the fourth quarter of 2013. As such, we reclassified the $582.5
million carrying value of our Notes to current liabilities and reclassified $77.5 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our Notes of $660.0 million and the carrying value of the Notes, from additional paid-in
capital to mezzanine equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September&nbsp;30, 2013. Similarly, debt issuance costs previously recorded in other assets were reclassified to other current assets as of September&nbsp;30, 2013. Should
the closing price conditions be met in the fourth quarter of 2013 or a future quarter, the Notes will be convertible at their holders&#146; option during the immediately following quarters. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;20, 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing Bank (FFB), and the DOE, pursuant to the Advanced
Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Incentive Program. This loan facility was subsequently amended from time to time, including in September 2012, to amend the timing of pre-funding the principal payment due in June 2013 and in March 2013 to
accelerate the maturity date of the DOE Loan Facility to December&nbsp;15, 2017 and create an obligation to repay approximately 1.0% of the outstanding principal under the DOE Loan Facility on or before June&nbsp;15, 2013. We refer to the loan
facility with the DOE as the DOE Loan Facility. Under the DOE Loan Facility, the FFB had made available to us two multi-draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $465.0 million. As of August&nbsp;31, 2012, we had fully drawn down
the aforementioned facilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All outstanding amounts under the DOE Loan Facility were repayable in quarterly installments, which
commenced on December&nbsp;15, 2012 and would have been due on the maturity date of December&nbsp;15, 2017. On May&nbsp;22, 2013, in connection with the closing of our offerings of common stock and Notes, we paid $451.8 million to settle all
outstanding loan amounts of $441.0 million, including principal and interest, as well as an early repayment penalty of $10.8 million which is recorded in interest expense for the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the DOE Loan Facility, we had agreed to pre-fund a dedicated debt service reserve account with our planned loan repayments as required
by the DOE loan facility. Upon termination of the DOE Loan Facility, $29.3 million held in this dedicated account was released by the DOE. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we had also issued a warrant to the DOE to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our
Series&nbsp;E convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. Upon the completion of our initial public offering on July&nbsp;2, 2010, this preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase up to 3,090,111 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $7.54 per share. As a result of our repayment of all outstanding principal and interest under the DOE Loan Facility and the termination of the DOE Loan Facility in May 2013, the DOE warrant expired. Additionally, we
amortized all remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the DOE Loan Facility. During the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, we recorded $5.8 million to interest expense. During the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
2012, we amortized $0.2 million and $0.5 million to interest expense, respectively. </P>

determine the fair value of an RSU based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of employee stock options
which requires a number of assumptions to determine the model inputs. These include the expected volatility of the stock&#146;s market price, the expected term of the stock-based awards, the expected risk free rate of interest and any dividend
yields. As stock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. We estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected
future employee turnover. As we have been operating as a public company for a period of time that is shorter than our estimated expected option life, we concluded that our historical price volatility does not provide a reasonable basis for input
assumptions within the Black-Scholes valuation model when determining the fair value of its stock options. As a result, our expected volatility is derived from our implied volatility and the historical volatilities of several unrelated public
companies within industries related to our business, including the automotive OEM, automotive retail, automotive parts and battery technology industries. Our historical volatility and implied volatility are weighted based on certain qualitative
factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>2012 CEO Grant </I></B></P>

combination of one of the ten pre-determined performance achievements and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of $4.0 billion, as compared to the initial market capitalization of $3.2 billion at the time of the 2012 CEO Grant.
Stock-based compensation expense associated with the 2012 CEO Grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point

Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). NUMMI has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont site which affect soil and groundwater, and until recently, were undertaking efforts to address these conditions. These conditions are now
being addressed by us and NUMMI. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has documented and managed the environmental issues and we completed a reasonable level of diligence on such environmental issues at the time we purchased the facility,
we cannot determine the potential costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination with any certainty. Based on management&#146;s best estimate, we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $5.3 million. The
fair value of these liabilities was determined based on an expected value analysis of the related potential costs to investigate, remediate and manage various environmental conditions that were identified as part of NUMMI&#146;s facility
decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence efforts. As we continue with our construction and operating activities, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any
governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions, and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such
remediation activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement, subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth
anniversary date of the closing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the ten-year anniversary of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has been spent on the remediation
activities, whichever comes first, NUMMI&#146;s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the Fremont site. At </P>

design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We introduced our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, in early 2008. The Roadster&#146;s proprietary electric vehicle
powertrain system is the foundation of our powertrain technology and, with design enhancements, forms the basis for our Model S sedan, our Model X crossover and other future vehicles. We commenced deliveries of Model S in June 2012 and increased
production to an annualized rate of 20,000&nbsp;per year by the end of 2012. We have continued to increase our production rate to meet our current external guidance of 21,500 deliveries in 2013. In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of
the Model X crossover, a vehicle based on the Model S platform. We plan to start production of the initial units of Model X in late 2014 and subsequently ramp up to full production by the second quarter of 2015. We sell our vehicles through our own
sales and service network. We are also building a network of Superchargers to allow Model S owners to charge their cars at a very fast rate for free. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We delivered slightly over 5,500 Model S vehicles during the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, an increase from slightly over 5,150
Model S vehicles for the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2013. During the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, we recognized total revenues of $431.3 million, an increase of $381.2 million over total revenues of $50.1 million for the three
months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012, primarily driven by the ramp up in Model S deliveries which commenced in North America in June 2012 and the launch of European Model S deliveries which commenced in August 2013, regulatory credit sales and
powertrain component sales to Toyota for the Toyota RAV4 EV. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gross margin for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 was 23.9%, a
slight decrease from 24.8% for the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2013, as a result of significantly lower sales of regulatory credits, partially offset by continued Model S cost improvements and manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies, an
increased average selling price due to the start of European deliveries, as well as a higher mix of 85 kWh battery packs and other options. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 were $56.4 million, a decrease from $61.9
million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012. R&amp;D expenses for the third quarter of 2012 included expenses related to our continued development and testing activities of Model S, including our activities to homologate Model S for
the rest of the world and to introduce the 60 kWh battery pack option. R&amp;D expenses for the third quarter of 2013 reflected our activities on the right-hand drive Model S and localization efforts for foreign markets, as well as development work
on Model X. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, we continued to expand our company-owned network of stores, service
centers and Superchargers both in North America and Europe. With the higher expenses associated with the global expansion of our service and Supercharger network infrastructure, store network and the business in general including our information
technology infrastructure, selling, general and administrative expenses were $77.1 million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, compared to $37.8 million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We ended the quarter with $796.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, and current restricted
cash, an increase of $49.0 million from the end of the second quarter. We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will continue to provide us with adequate liquidity
based on our current plans. However, if market conditions are favorable, we may evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the third quarter of 2013, certain conditions with respect to the closing prices of our common stock in accordance with the terms of
our Notes were met and accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holder&#146;s option during the fourth quarter of 2013. As such, the carrying value of the Notes was classified to current liabilities as of September&nbsp;30, 2013 and the
difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Notes was reclassified from permanent equity to mezzanine equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September&nbsp;30, 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2013, we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) to, among other things,
extend the term of the agreement by two years until December&nbsp;31, 2017 and provide for the long-term preferential prices and a minimum of 1.8 billion lithium-ion battery cells that we will purchase from Panasonic from 2014 through 2017. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are presently producing 550 vehicles per week. We expect that production will continue to increase during the fourth quarter and throughout
2014. At the higher production level, we currently expect to achieve total deliveries of 21,500 Model S vehicles worldwide in 2013, thereby continuing to significantly increase automotive sales. We are presently not constrained by demand, but
instead by our ability to ramp production. While we continue to ramp production, in the near term the increase in cell capacity from our supplier is a key constraint that we are managing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through June&nbsp;30, 2013, we had delivered Model S vehicles solely to customers in North America. In August 2013, we started European
deliveries of Model S. Similar to the initial launch of Model S in the United States and in Canada, we experienced an increase in our average selling price during the third quarter of 2013 due to the start of delivery of European Signature Series
vehicles, and a higher mix of 85 kWh cars and other options in all markets. The average selling price is expected to remain relatively flat in the fourth quarter as we continue to see a rich mix of options on incoming orders. Although we have gained
experience with the delivery process in North America, we have only recently commenced deliveries in Europe and have not delivered Model S vehicles outside of North America in volume; thus, we may face difficulties meeting our delivery plans in both
Europe and Asia, which may impact our ability to achieve our delivery goals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, we began offering a resale value guarantee to
all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners, and in October 2013, we introduced this program in Canada. Under the program, Model S customers have the
option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a pre-determined resale value. We account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases and accordingly, we defer and
amortize to automotive sales revenue the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straight-line basis, over the contractual term of the guarantee program. Similarly, we capitalize and depreciate the cost of the
respective operating lease vehicles less resale value guarantee amount to cost of automotive sales over the same period. If a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term, any unamortized
deferred revenue and operating lease vehicle net book value are then recognized in automotive sales and cost of automotive sales, respectively. </P>
 <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">24 </P>

<h5 align="left"><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The resale value guarantee amount represents management&#146;s best estimate as to the resale
value of the Model S vehicle and related vehicle options during the 36 to 39 month period after delivery which is currently approximately 50% of the base vehicle selling price and 43% of the price of any vehicle options. Since we are depreciating
our operating lease vehicles to the resale value guarantee amount, we will adjust our depreciation estimates as needed if the resale value is expected to decrease in future periods. As we accumulate more actual data related to the resale experience
of Model S, we may be required to make significant changes to our estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the third quarter of 2013, we provided the resale
value guarantee to approximately 44% of Model S deliveries in North America, an increase from 31% in the second quarter. We expect the penetration rate of the resale value guarantee to remain at the current level in the near-term. Our application of
lease accounting to Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee will not impact our cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program has and will continue to
adversely impact our 2013 revenues and operating results based on our current expectations of participation in such programs. Furthermore, while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, we are exposed to the risk that the
vehicles&#146; resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to sales of Model S, we continue to recognize automotive sales from our supply of powertrain systems to Toyota for the Toyota RAV4
EV. However, Toyota is not obligated to continue to purchase powertrain systems from us over an extended period of time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2012, we
began work on a full electric powertrain under the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV program. Under this program, we continue to provide development services and deliver prototype samples in 2013. Similar to our previous development services agreements, due
to timing differences that may arise between the recognition of milestone revenues and the underlying costs of development services, the gross margin from our development services activities may vary from period to period. This was the case during
the third quarter of 2013 where we did not recognize any milestone revenues but recorded development services costs as incurred. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During
the third quarter of 2013, significant cost improvements were achieved, including part cost reductions, as well as manufacturing efficiencies. We expect these trends to continue as we execute on our roadmap of achieving further component cost
reductions as well as continued manufacturing and logistics efficiencies. We therefore expect our gross margin to continue to rise to our target of 25% in the fourth quarter of 2013, which assumes no revenue from zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credit.
We may not be able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives, which would negatively affect our ability to reach our gross margin goals. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the third quarter of 2013, we recognized $10.4 million in ZEV credit sales which contributed to our gross margin. ZEV credit revenue
decreased significantly from $51.5 million in the second quarter of 2013 and should continue to decline in future quarters relative to our automotive sales as we grow our sales outside the United States. While we will pursue opportunities to
monetize ZEV credits we earn from the sales of our vehicles, we do not plan to rely on these sales to be a significant contributor to gross margin, and our business model is not predicated on such ZEV credits. Other regulatory credit sales
recognized during the third quarter of 2013 were $14.8 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover
as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. We currently plan to start production of the initial units of Model&nbsp;X in late 2014 and subsequently ramp up to full production by the second quarter of 2015. Our
ability to launch this program on time and cost efficiently is dependent upon a variety of factors, including supplier readiness, engineering completion and testing. Moreover, in 2014 we intend to continue to make progress on the design work and
styling of the Gen III vehicle. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the third quarter of 2013, we continued to expand our stores and service infrastructure in
order to expand our geographical presence and to provide better service in areas with a high concentration of Model S customers. To help drive demand in new geographic areas, we have also begun complementing our store strategy with sales locations
within service centers to more rapidly and efficiently expand our retail footprint. As of the end of the quarter, we had stores, galleries and service centers in over 100 locations around the world, and plan to open several more stores, galleries
and service centers in 2013, including our first store in Beijing, China. We continue to build service infrastructure in advance of demand to ensure that after-sale services are available when and where needed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the end of May 2013, we announced the significant expansion of our Supercharger network as well as upcoming Supercharging technology that
will reduce charging time at our Superchargers. Since the time of our announcement, we have been installing Superchargers at an accelerating pace. We currently have over 30 Supercharging stations open, and are continuing to expand our network both
in North America and in Europe. If we experience difficulties in finding suitable sites, negotiating leases or obtaining required permits for such locations, our planned expansion of such Superchargers could be delayed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our research and development expenses are expected to increase sequentially by about 25% in the fourth quarter of 2013 as we accelerate
product development efforts on Model X and Model S enhancements. Our selling, general and administrative expenses are also expected to increase sequentially by about 20%, driven by the growth in our retail locations, service centers and Supercharger
facilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we anticipate growing global demand for Model S, we plan to expand our factory production capability and customer support
infrastructure. We expect to spend approximately $75 million to $85 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2013, bringing total expected capital expenditures for 2013 to $250 million. We anticipate that we will continue to
expand our factory production capability and customer support infrastructure in 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the third quarter of 2013, certain
conditions with respect to the closing prices of our common stock in accordance with the terms of our Notes were met and accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holder&#146;s option during the fourth quarter of 2013. Should such closing price
conditions be met in the fourth quarter of 2013 or a future quarter, the Notes will be convertible by their holders during the immediately following quarter. Upon conversion of the Notes, we will be obligated to pay cash for the principal amount of
the converted Notes and we may also have to deliver shares of our common stock in respect of such converted Notes. Any conversion of the Notes prior to their maturity or acceleration of the repayment of the Notes could have a material adverse effect
on our cash flows, business, results of operations and financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates </B></P>

billion, respectively, an increase from $50.0 million and $91.3 million during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012, respectively. Vehicle, options and related sales represent revenues related to deliveries of Model S and the

were $422.0 million and $1.35 billion, respectively, an increase from $39.6 million and $74.0 million during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012, respectively. The significant increase in vehicle, options and related sales was
primarily driven by the delivery of slightly over 5,500 Model S vehicles for the quarter, including the commencement of European deliveries in August 2013. The increase also resulted from higher sales of regulatory credits including $10.4 million
and $130.0 million in zero emission credit sales for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, respectively, compared to $2.5 million and $3.0 million for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and financed their
vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners, and in October 2013, we introduced this program in Canada. Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39
months for a pre-determined resale value. We account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases and accordingly, we defer and amortize to revenues the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee
amount on a straight-line basis, over the contractual term of the guarantee program. If a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term, any unamortized deferred revenue is then recognized in
automotive sales. As of September&nbsp;30, 2013, we recorded $160.8 million in deferred revenues and $159.0 million in resale value guarantee related to Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee. During the three and nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2013, we recognized revenue of $9.4 million and $11.3 million in automotive sales related to this program, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Powertrain component and related sales for the periods presented were related to powertrain component sales to Toyota under the RAV4 EV supply
and services agreement which commenced in March 2012. Powertrain component and related sales for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 was $7.2 million, a decrease from $10.4 million during the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012.
Powertrain component and related sales for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 was $34.9 million, an increase from $17.4 million during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the first half of 2012, we received two purchase orders from Daimler related to the
development of a full electric powertrain for a Daimler Mercedes-Benz vehicle and recognized $4.3 million in development services revenue during the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2012. In October 2010, we entered into a Phase 1 contract services
agreement with Toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which would be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. During
the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2012, we completed our remaining milestones and delivered samples under the Phase 1 agreement and recognized $10.7 million of development services revenue. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cost of automotive sales during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 were $324.9 million and $1.09 billion, respectively,
an increase from $58.9 million and $92.9 million during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012, respectively. Cost of automotive sales includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including amortized
tooling costs, royalty fees, shipping and logistic costs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it
exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. The increase in cost of automotive sales was driven primarily by Model S deliveries, including the commencement of European
deliveries in August 2013, as well as deliveries of electric powertrain component and systems to Toyota under the Toyota RAV4 EV supply and services agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S and financed their vehicle and vehicle
options through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under the program, we capitalize the cost of Model S into operating lease vehicles and depreciate the respective operating lease vehicles less resale value guarantee amount to cost of
automotive sales on a straight-line basis, over the contractual term of the guarantee program. If a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term, the remaining operating lease vehicle net book
value is then recognized in automotive sales. As of September&nbsp;30, 2013, we recorded $262.8 million in operating lease vehicles, net, related to Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee. During the three and nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2013, we recognized $5.9 million and $7.3 million in cost of automotive sales related to vehicle depreciation under this program, respectively. Our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our
resale value guarantee vehicles as such actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, warranty costs incurred for our resale value guarantee vehicles were $0.7 million and $1.1 million,
respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gross profit during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 was $102.9 million and $299.7 million,
respectively, an increase from a gross loss of $8.8 million and gross profit of $6.2 million during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012, respectively. These increases were driven primarily by Model S deliveries which began in
June 2012 in North America and in August 2013 in Europe and the sales of regulatory credits which carry no associated cost of revenues. The increase is also attributable to our continuing cost reduction efforts including process efficiencies in
manufacturing and supply chain, design improvements, as well as reduction of waste in the supply chain. </P>

million, a $10.8 million early repayment fee and accrued interest of $1.4 million. As a result of the extinguishment of our loans, unamortized loan origination costs associated with the DOE Loan Facility of $5.6 million were charged to interest
expense. During the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013, we recorded total interest expense of $17.8 million related to the early repayment fee, accrued interest and the amortization of the remaining loan origination costs on the DOE Loan
Facility. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability and foreign exchange
gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Prior to the expiration of the DOE warrant in
May 2013, the DOE warrant had been carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other income (expense), net. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other expense, net, during the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 was $0.7 million, a decrease from $2.2 million during the three
months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012. The decrease in other expense, net, was primarily due to the foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currency-denominated liabilities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other income, net, during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 was $18.0 million, an increase in income compared to other expense,
net, of $2.6 million during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012. The increase in other income, net, was primarily due to the reduction in fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability of $10.7 million during the nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2013. In March 2013, we entered into a fourth amendment to the DOE Loan Facility which, among other things, accelerated the maturity date of our DOE loans to December&nbsp;15, 2017; therefore, the DOE warrant was no longer
expected to vest. The increase in other income, net, was also attributable to the favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currency-denominated liabilities in the first half of 2013, especially related to the Japanese yen. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Provision for Income Taxes </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our
provision for income taxes during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 were $0.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, compared to $0.1 million and $0.3 million during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2012,
respectively. The increase during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 was due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions as we commenced European deliveries of Model S in August 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Liquidity and Capital Resources </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since inception and through September&nbsp;30, 2013, we had accumulated net operating losses of $1.12 billion and have used $596.5 million of
cash in operations. As of September&nbsp;30, 2013, we had $795.1 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents including $371.3 million of money market funds. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other sources of cash include cash from our deliveries of Model S, customer deposits for Model S and Model X, sales of regulatory credits,
cash from the provision of development services, and sales of powertrain components and systems. We expect that our current sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating
activities, will continue to provide us with adequate liquidity based on our current plans. These capital sources will enable us to fund our ongoing operations, continue research and development projects, including those for our planned Model X
crossover and future products, establish and expand our stores, service centers and Supercharger network and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce Model X and to continue to ramp up production of Model S.
If market conditions are favorable, we may evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options. </P>

affect the estimates of our future cash requirements, we could be required to fund our cash requirements through additional or alternative sources of financing. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms
when required, or at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>1.50%&nbsp;Convertible Senior Notes and Call Spread </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2013, we issued $660.0&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the Notes) in a public
offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0&nbsp;million. We incurred $12.0&nbsp;million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the Notes which we have recorded in
other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the Notes. The interest under the Notes is fixed at 1.50%&nbsp;per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June&nbsp;1 and
December&nbsp;1 of each year, commencing on December&nbsp;1, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes will initially be convertible
into 8.0306&nbsp;shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $124.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes at their
option on or after March&nbsp;1, 2018. Further, holders of the Notes may convert their Notes at their option prior to March&nbsp;1, 2018, only under the following circumstances: (1)&nbsp;during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter
ending September&nbsp;30, 2013, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30&nbsp;consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater
than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2)&nbsp;during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the Notes is less than 98% of the average of
the closing sale price of our common stock for each day during such five trading day period; or (3)&nbsp;if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion, we would pay
the holders in cash for the principal amount of the Note and, if applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a calculated daily conversion
value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued
and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the third quarter of 2013, the closing price of our common stock met or exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our
Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of the Notes may convert their Notes during the fourth quarter of 2013. As such, we reclassified the $582.5 million carrying value of our Notes to
current liabilities and reclassified $77.5 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our Notes of $660.0 million and the carrying value of the Notes, from additional paid-in capital to mezzanine equity on our condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of September&nbsp;30, 2013. Similarly, debt issuance costs previously recorded in other assets were reclassified to other current assets as of September&nbsp;30, 2013. Should the closing price conditions be met in the
fourth quarter of 2013 or a future quarter, the Notes will be convertible at their holders&#146; option during the immediately following quarter. As of the date of this filing, none of the Notes have been converted by their
holders.&nbsp;Furthermore, under current market conditions, we expect that almost none of the Notes will be converted in the short term. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions
whereby we have the option to purchase up to 5.3&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $124.52 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $177.5&nbsp;million. In addition, we sold warrants
whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase up to approximately 5.3&nbsp;million shares of our common stock at a price of $184.48 per share. We received $120.3&nbsp;million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken
together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per share.

associated with the reduction in fair value of the DOE common stock warrant liability of $10.7 million. Significant operating cash inflows were comprised primarily of automotive sales of $1.39 billion, a $377.8 million net increase in deferred
revenue, resale value guarantee and other long-term liabilities primarily associated with Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee, $11.3 million of development services revenue and a $1.5 million net increase in customer deposits,
partially offset by a $20.7 million increase in accounts receivable due to the regulatory credit sales recognized at the end of the third quarter and receivables from our financing partners. Significant operating cash outflows for the nine months

through September&nbsp;30, 2013, we have delivered Model S vehicles primarily to customers in North America. Through September&nbsp;30, 2013, a significant majority of our revenues have been denominated in U.S. dollars. However, a portion of our
costs and expenses during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013 was denominated in foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, euro and British pound. Accordingly, when the value of the U.S. dollar has depreciated against these
currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues have correspondingly increased which adversely impacted our operating results. We started European deliveries of the Model S in August 2013 and plan to start Asian
deliveries in 2014. As we continue to launch Model S overseas, we may have greater revenues than costs denominated in other currencies, in which case a strengthening of the dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of a favorable foreign currency exchange impact from foreign currency-denominated liabilities, especially related to the Japanese

evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September&nbsp;30, 2013. The term &#147;disclosure controls and procedures,&#148; as defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e)&nbsp;and 15d-15(e)&nbsp;under the Exchange Act, means
controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules&nbsp;and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company&#146;s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September&nbsp;30, 2013, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as a result of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting,
as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September&nbsp;30, 2013. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 because a material
weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to the presentation and disclosure of non-cash capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we
did not design effective controls to determine and review the total unpaid amounts related to capital expenditures that should have been excluded from operating and investing activities in the cash flow statement and disclosed as non-cash items. In
response to the material weakness in internal controls described above, during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013, we began to include as part of our financial reporting review process, the determination of total unpaid amounts related to
capital expenditures that should be excluded from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows and disclosed as non-cash items. We believe that our improved processes and procedures will assist in the remediation of the material
weakness. We will subject these procedures to appropriate tests, in order to determine whether they are operating effectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Management

possible controls and procedures. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

factors, including our suppliers&#146; ability to deliver quality parts to us in a timely manner, our ability to use our manufacturing processes as planned for volume production while maintaining
our desired quality levels and efficiently making design changes to ensure consistently high quality. The Model S is an all new vehicle which we are producing with new employees using new equipment and therefore our production processes are still
maturing. To produce a vehicle that meets our quality standards requires us to carefully analyze each step of our production plan, improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue to train our employees. Our suppliers also must
produce new products in sufficient quantities and quality levels to meet our demand. Certain suppliers have experienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements, and we continue to focus on
supplier capabilities and constraints. Any disruption in maintaining our production level of Model S could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have only recently increased our Model S delivery rates in the United States to match our current and anticipated Model S production
capacity. We have limited experience in the high volume delivery of our Model S vehicles. We are presently producing 550 vehicles per week and we intend to continue to increase the production rate over the next several quarters. Furthermore, we have
limited experience delivering vehicles outside of the United States and thus may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans in both Europe and Asia as we only began European deliveries of the Model S in August of this year and will not
start Asian deliveries until early 2014. If we are unable to increase the production rate and increase our weekly delivery rate to match our production rate of Model S, ramp up deliveries in Europe and Asia and sustain a high level of weekly Model S
deliveries throughout the year, this could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, for Model S we have introduced a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques, such as aluminum spot welding systems,
which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry, and Model S has a number of new and unique design features, such as a 17 inch display screen, newly designed retractable exterior door handles and a panoramic roof, each of which poses
unique manufacturing challenges. Model S production and deliveries will continue to require significant resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity for Model
S, or cause us to miss planned production targets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Additionally, sustaining high volume production and doing so in a manner that avoids significant
cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, may be difficult. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our

numerous purchased parts which we source globally from over 300 direct suppliers, the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers for these components. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other
automobile manufacturers, the majority of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from single sources. To date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we do not
maintain long-term agreements with a number of our suppliers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply
relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term, or at all, at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we believe that we will be
able to secure alternate sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be
time consuming, costly and may force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle&#146;s design. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This supply chain exposes us to
multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for Model S, as well as for our powertrain component sales activities. For example, earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in Japan in March 2011 could negatively impact our
supply chain. We have in the past experienced source disruptions in our supply chains, including those relating to our slower-than-anticipated ramp in our Model S production goals for 2012. We may experience additional delays in the future with
respect to Model S and any other future vehicle we may produce. In addition, because we have written agreements in place with the majority, but not all of, our suppliers, this may create uncertainty regarding certain suppliers&#146; obligations to
us, including but not limited to, those regarding warranty and product liability. Changes in business conditions, wars, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our
suppliers&#146; ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we experience significantly increased demand, or need to replace certain existing suppliers, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts
will be available when required on terms that are favorable to </P>

us, at all, or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. In the past, we have replaced certain suppliers
because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards. The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to
our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost and delay. We have also experienced
cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made, and we may experience similar cost increases in the future. Additionally, we are negotiating
with existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them cheaper to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier
costs, our operating results will suffer. Additionally, cost reduction efforts may interrupt or harm our normal production processes, thereby harming Model S quality or reducing Model S production output. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, a failure by our suppliers to provide the components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our
performance electric vehicles such as Model S could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, in October 2013, we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with Panasonic
Corporation in order to address our anticipated short- to medium-term lithium ion battery cell needs.&nbsp;While we expect that this supply agreement, as amended, will provide us with sufficient cells for the next few years, we may not be able to
meet our long-term needs, including for Gen III and other programs we may introduce, without securing additional suppliers or other sources for cells.&nbsp;If we cannot secure such additional suppliers or sources, we could experience production
delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are unable to adequately
reduce the manufacturing costs of Model S or otherwise control the costs associated with operating our business, our financial condition and operating results will suffer. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our production costs for Model S were high initially due to start-up costs at the Tesla Factory, manufacturing inefficiencies including low
absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, higher logistics costs due to the immaturity of our supply chain, and higher initial prices for component parts during the initial period after the launch and ramp of Model S. As we are presently producing
550 vehicles per week, manufacturing costs have continued to fall. While we expect further cost reduction efforts undertaken by both us and our suppliers will continue to reduce costs during the next several quarters, there is no guarantee that we
will be able to achieve planned cost reductions from our various cost savings initiatives, and the failure to achieve such savings would negatively affect our ability to reach our gross margin and profitability goals. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our high-performance electric cars, assembling
vehicles and compensating our personnel. We may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of Model S and powertrain manufacturing facilities and the planned launch in Asia in early 2014. If Model S
tooling, production equipment and parts are insufficient for use in Model X, perhaps as a result of a lower level of commonality between the two vehicles than we currently anticipate, our costs related to the production of Model X may exceed
expectations and our ability to optimize gross margin will be reduced. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, in the future we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses
to promote our vehicles, including through the use of traditional media such as television, radio and print, even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited as we have to date relied upon unconventional marketing efforts. If
we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed. Furthermore, many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control. For
example, the costs of our raw materials and components, such as lithium-ion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels, could increase due to shortages as global demand for these products increases. Indeed, if the popularity of electric
vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology, shortages could occur which would result in increased material costs to us or potentially limit our
ability to expand production. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our long-term success will be dependent upon our ability to design and achieve market acceptance of

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our long-term success is dependent on market acceptance of two new vehicles: the Model S sedan and the Model X crossover. In the United States,
there is no guarantee that Model S will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public, especially in the long-term. As we expand in Europe and enter into Asia, there is no guarantee that customers in these markets will embrace our
vehicles and if they do not, demand for our vehicles could be lower than our expectations. For example, we have experienced greater initial success in selling Model S vehicles in Norway than in the rest of Europe. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to design future electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our
customers or that our future models, including Model X, will become commercially viable. To date, we have publicly revealed only an early prototype of the Model X. To the extent that we are not able to build Model X to the expectations created by
the early prototype and our announced specifications, customers may cancel their reservations, our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose confidence in us. In addition, we have also announced our intent to develop a third generation
electric vehicle (&#147;Gen III&#148;) which we expect to produce at the Tesla Factory after the introduction of Model X. We have very limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple models of
vehicles, such as Model S (including any variants we introduce such as right-hand drive), Model X and Gen III. Also, if we fail to accurately anticipate demand for each of our vehicles, this could result in inefficient expenditures and production
delays. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently.
In order to meet these expectations, we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As technologies change in the future for automobiles in general and
performance electric vehicles specifically, we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology and meet customer expectations. To date, we have limited
experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling our electric vehicles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our future

manufacturing personnel, design personnel, engineers and service technicians for our performance electric vehicles. Because our high-performance vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines, we
may not be able to hire individuals with sufficient training in performance electric vehicles, and we will need to expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire. Competition for individuals with experience designing,
manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future, the failure of which could seriously harm our business, prospects,
operating results and financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects

address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed. We were formed in July 2003 and began delivering our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, in early 2008. We only began
producing our second electric vehicle, Model S, in June 2012 and our production processes continue to mature, especially those production processes related to our Model&nbsp;S deliveries in Europe and our planned deliveries in Asia, such as for
right-hand drive Model S. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We historically derived our revenues principally from sales of the Tesla Roadster and from electric powertrain
development services and sales. Model S became the primary contributor to our revenue starting in the fourth quarter of 2012. We intend in the longer term to derive substantial revenues from the sales of Model S, Model X, Gen III and future electric
vehicles. We have only a very limited operating history with respect to Model S. While we expect Model S cost reduction efforts undertaken by both us and our suppliers will continue to reduce the costs of manufacturing Model S during the next
several quarters, the success and timing of such efforts is difficult to predict, which limits our ability to precisely forecast the cost of producing Model S. Further, we have only produced an early prototype of the Model X crossover and have not
yet started production of Model S for Asia. Our vehicle design and our engineering, manufacturing&nbsp;and component supply plans for Model S may continue to be adjusted. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, our powertrain component sales, development services revenue and powertrain research and development compensation have been
almost entirely generated under arrangements with Daimler AG (Daimler) and Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota), and there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into future agreements with these companies on favorable terms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, it is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends

catch fire or vent smoke and flame, and such events have raised concerns, and future events may lead to additional concerns, about the batteries used in automotive applications. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The battery pack in the Tesla Roadster and Model S makes use of lithium-ion cells. We also currently intend to make use of lithium-ion cells in
battery packs that we sell to Toyota and Daimler as well as any future vehicles we may produce. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials
as well as other lithium-ion cells. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. More recently, multiple Chevrolet Volt battery pack fires,
followed by a government investigation into the cause of such fires focused considerable public attention, as well as the attention of NHTSA, on the safety of electric vehicles. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These events have raised concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of
cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. We have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell&#146;s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells. However, we
have delivered only a limited number of Tesla Roadsters and Model S sedans to customers and have limited field experience with our vehicles, especially Model S. We have also only delivered a limited number of battery packs to Toyota and Daimler.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our Model S or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. We may
have to recall our vehicles or participate in a recall of a vehicle that contains our battery packs, and redesign our battery packs, which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of
lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve us, could seriously harm our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our manufacturing facility. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause
disruption to the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage
or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor&#146;s electric vehicle, especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to the Tesla Roadster or
Model&nbsp;S, may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our electric vehicles. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P>

vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains such as the Toyota RAV4 EV or future Daimler vehicles may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. For example, our
vehicles use a substantial amount of software code to operate. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced, and changes to software may have unexpected effects. Recent Model S issues
experienced by customers include those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery. Although we are attempting to remedy the Model S issues experienced by our customers in a rapid manner by
expanding our service centers and personnel, such efforts may not be timely or up to the satisfaction of our customers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we have
performed extensive internal testing, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term performance of our battery packs, powertrains and vehicles. Specifically, we have only a limited amount of data by which to
evaluate Model S, upon which our business prospects depend, due to the fact that we only recently began production in June 2012. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to
consumers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We experienced product recalls in May 2009,&nbsp;October 2010 and June 2013, all of which were unrelated to our electric
powertrain. In May 2009, we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during the
manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider, which is the partially assembled Tesla Roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single
vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. In June 2013, we initiated a recall of slightly more than a thousand Model S vehicles to
inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process. Rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in an upright position. Failure of this component may have resulted in the collapse of the
rear seat back during a crash. Although the cost of this recall was not material, and limited to a small number of total Model S&#146;s produced, we may experience additional recalls in the future, which could adversely affect our brand in our
target markets, as well as our business, prospects and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our electric vehicles may not perform consistent with
customers&#146; expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available. For example, our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles, and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the
market. Additionally, while Model S recently achieved an overall five star safety rating by NHTSA, such rating is not a guarantee of safe product design or that any individual vehicle will be free of any defect or failure. Any product defects or any
other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and reputation, and
significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. </P>

our operational costs while producing quality Model S vehicles at volume, maintain our Model S delivery rates to match our current and anticipated Model S production capacity, maintain strong demand for Model S in the U.S., and grow demand for Model
S abroad. Failure to do one or more of these things could prevent us from achieving sustained, long-term profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The
introduction of our resale value guarantee may result in lower revenues and profits and exposes us to resale risk to the extent many customers elect to return their vehicles to us and the residual values of these cars are below the guaranteed value.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recently began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and Canada and
financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a pre-determined
resale value.&nbsp;As a result of this resale value guarantee and customers having the option of selling their vehicles to us, we apply lease accounting to such purchases, which defers the recognition of the associated revenues over time instead of
full recognition at vehicle delivery. During the third quarter of 2013, we provided the resale value guarantee to approximately 50% of Model S deliveries in the United States in states where the program is available and we expect the penetration
rate to increase with the expansion of our financing programs in additional states in the United States and in international markets. Although lease accounting will not impact our cash flows and liquidity, a significant uptake under this program
could have a significant adverse impact on our near term revenues and operating results and our ability to achieve sustained profitability in the near term.&nbsp;Furthermore, while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, we are
exposed to the risk that the vehicles&#146; resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates. Currently, there is only a very limited secondary market for our electric vehicles
in particular, and electric vehicles in general, on which to base our estimates, and such a secondary market may not develop in the future. Our residual value and return volume estimates could prove to be incorrect, either of which could harm our
financial condition and operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials, in particular

nickel and copper. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks

increases in the prices for our raw materials or prices charged to us, such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through
increased electric vehicle prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase Model S prices in response to increased raw material costs could be

fall of 2008, the episode about the Tesla Roadster has been rebroadcast repeatedly around the world. The review of the Tesla Roadster included a number of significant falsehoods regarding the car&#146;s performance, range and safety. Such criticisms
create a negative public perception about the Tesla Roadster, and to the extent that these comments are believed by the public, may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles such as Model&nbsp;S or Model&nbsp;X,

vehicle at one of the two Supercharger locations along the route. As a result, the Model S failed to complete the journey under its own power and the NY Times reporter published a negative review. While there were subsequent corrections by the NY
Times Public Editor regarding the reporter&#146;s failure to conform to all Tesla recommendations, as well as problems with &#147;precision and judgment,&#148; the original story still created a negative public perception about Model S, its

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other aspects of our distribution model also differ from those used by traditional automobile manufacturers. For example, we do not anticipate
that we will ever carry a significant amount of Model S inventory at our stores and customers may need to wait up to a few months from the time they place an order until the time they receive their vehicle. This type of custom manufacturing is
unusual in the premium sedan market in the United States and it is unproven whether the average customer will be willing to wait this amount of time for such a vehicle. If customers do not embrace this ordering and retail experience, our business
will be harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are

our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or
malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles, including Model S. A successful product
liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other
future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. We self-insure against the risk of product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a
material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face
liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under such a policy. </P>

are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems, including implementing new internally developed systems, to assist us in the management of our business. In particular, our volume production of Model S in the U.S. and abroad
necessitates continued development, maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems, which include product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer
management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. These systems support our operations and enable us to produce Model S in volume. The implementation, maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time,
support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement processes, manufacturing
execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes that may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service vehicles, or achieve and maintain compliance with, or
realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations. We cannot be sure that these expanded systems or their required functionality will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, or maintained. If we do
not successfully implement, improve or maintain these systems, our operations may be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed. In addition, these systems or their functionality may not operate as we expect them to, and we may be required

the Tesla Supercharger network throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe, but we may be unable to do so due to a number of factors, including the inability to secure, or delays in securing, suitable locations and permits, difficulties in interfacing
with the infrastructures of various utility companies and greater than expected costs and difficulties of installing, maintaining and operating the network. We may also be unable to expand the Supercharger network as fast as we intend or as the
public expects, or to place the charging stations in places our customers believe to be optimal. In addition, as we have announced that we will not be charging our customers to access this network in addition to what they have already paid for their
vehicles, any significant unexpected costs that we encounter will entirely be borne by us and may harm our operating results. Although our Supercharger network is intended to address customer concerns regarding long-distance travel, this network may
not result in increased reservations or sales of Model S or future vehicles.&nbsp;If our Supercharger network is not expanded as currently planned or as quickly as planned, we may not realize the benefits of our Supercharger network and our business

adverse publicity for our business. In 2012, we also experienced delays in the ramp of Model S. We may experience similar delays, cost overruns and adverse publicity in launching Model X, any of which could be significant. We are in the design and
development stages of Model X. Furthermore, we have not yet evaluated, qualified or selected all of our suppliers for the planned production of Model X. We may not be able to engage suppliers for the components in a timely manner, at an acceptable
price or in the necessary quantities. We will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that Model X is in compliance with applicable NHTSA safety regulations and obtain EPA and CARB certification to emission regulations prior to beginning volume
production and delivery of the vehicles. In addition, we have limited resources and, to the extent that such engineering and manufacturing resources are devoted to the design and production of Model S or are otherwise engaged such as in development
services activities as they have been until now, we may have difficulty designing and delivering Model X in a timely manner. If we are not able to manufacture and deliver Model X in a timely manner and consistent with our production timeline, budget

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. In Japan,
Mitsubishi has been selling its fully electric iMiEV since April 2010 and Nissan has been selling the fully electric Nissan Leaf since December 2010. In the past few years, Ford has introduced the fully electric Ford Focus, Renault has introduced
the fully electric Renault Fluence, and Fiat has introduced the Fiat 500e, among others. Moreover, BMW intends to introduce the fully electric BMW i3 in November 2013 and Volkswagen plans to introduce its fully electric e-Golf and eUp! in 2014. In
addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General
Motors introduced the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery pack. </P>

Audi, are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also entered or announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign
countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Most of our current and potential
competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of
their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition
than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. Additionally, we have not in the past, and do not currently, offer
customary discounts on our vehicles like most of our competitors do. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in
light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing,
reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to
compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our cars or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at
the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile, which may

materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods.
For example, according to automotive industry sources, sales of passenger vehicles in North America during the fourth quarter of 2008 were over 30% lower than those during the same period in the prior year. Demand for automobile sales depends to a
large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more
established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we currently or will sell our electric vehicles, such as
Europe and Asia, will impact our business, prospects and operating results as well. Demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles, such as
sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and
increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively
smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers. </P>

such as our performance electric vehicles. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over the last few years, the continued challenging macroeconomic environment has
negatively impacted consumer spending and we believe has adversely affected the sales of our vehicles. The automobile industry in particular was severely impacted by the poor economic conditions, and several vehicle manufacturing companies,
including General Motors and Chrysler, were forced to file for bankruptcy. Sales of new automobiles in our two primary markets of the United States and Europe generally have dropped during this recessionary period, and have not yet recovered in
Europe. Sales of high-end and luxury consumer products, such as our performance electric vehicles, depend in part on discretionary consumer spending and are even more exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions. Difficult economic
conditions could therefore temporarily reduce the market for vehicles in our price range. Discretionary consumer spending also is affected by other factors, including changes in tax rates and tax credits, interest rates and the availability and
terms of consumer credit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the current difficult economic conditions continue or worsen, we may experience a decline in the demand for
Model S or future vehicles such as Model X or Gen III, any of which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We plan to grow our sales in Europe and Asia going forward. If there is a continued
downturn in the European economy, for example, our prospects of growth in Europe could be severely constrained which may harm our financial condition and operating results. </P>

costs and other factors. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our operating results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to many factors, including
seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles. Demand for new cars in the automobile industry typically declines over the winter season, while sales are generally higher during the spring and summer months. Sales
of the Tesla Roadster have fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters. We note that, in general, automotive sales
tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of Model S, Model X and other models we introduce may have similar seasonality. However, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or
extent of the seasonality of our business. Also, any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for our vehicles. Our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for
this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we expect our
period-to-period operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we, among other things, design, develop and manufacture Model X and electric powertrain components, increase
the production capacity at our manufacturing facilities to produce Model S and electric powertrain components, open new Tesla service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities, open new Supercharger locations, incur costs for warranty repairs
or product recalls, if any, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our
operating results, especially in the short-term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research
analysts or investors. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time. </P>

our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that

vehicle. Servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques. If we are unable to satisfactorily service our
customers and the various service related issues that they are facing and may face in the future, our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional Model S vehicles could be impaired. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We service our performance electric vehicles through our company-owned Tesla service centers, certain of our stores, and through our mobile
service technicians known as the Tesla Rangers. However, certain service centers have been open for short periods, and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles at these locations. We will need to open new standalone
service centers and hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these service centers and act as Tesla Rangers, in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles. We only implemented our Tesla
Rangers program in October 2009 and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers&#146; vehicles. There can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address
the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases. </P>

reside. In order to address the service needs of customers who are not in geographical proximity to our service centers, we plan to either transport those vehicles to the nearest Tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile Tesla
Rangers to service the vehicles at the customer&#146;s location. These special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers. In addition, a number of potential customers may
choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we do not adequately address our customers&#146; service needs, our brand and reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a
material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Traditional automobile manufacturers in the United States do not provide maintenance and repair
services directly. Consumers must rather service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. We do not have any such arrangements with third party service providers and it is unclear when or
even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles. At this point, we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future. As
our vehicles are placed in more locations, we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration
may result in negative publicity and reduced sales, thereby harming our business and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the motor vehicle industry
laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the state. Whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the
internet to consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain. While we believe our Tesla Ranger program and our practice of shipping customers&#146; vehicles to our nearest Tesla store for service would satisfy regulators in
these circumstances, without seeking formal regulatory guidance, there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states. Further, certain state franchise laws which prohibit
manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from providing vehicle service. If issues arise in connection with these laws, certain aspects of Tesla&#146;s service program would need
to be restructured to comply with state law, which may harm our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our business and prospects are heavily dependent on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand. Any failure to develop,
maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the Model S, Model X, Gen III and other future planned electric vehicles, and sell our electric powertrain components. If we do not continue to establish,
maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and
repair services, and we have very limited experience in these areas. Any problems associated with the Toyota RAV4 EV that uses a Tesla powertrain, potential future Daimler vehicles that use Tesla powertrains or the Model X may hurt the Tesla brand.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we expect that our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of
our marketing efforts. To date, we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet, word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand. To further promote our brand, we may be
required to change our marketing practices, which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses, including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we
may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in Detroit, Japan and the European Union, have greater name recognition,
broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong brand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.

time as we begin shipping significant quantities of Model S vehicles to Europe and Asia, we expect that a significant majority of our revenue will be denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly
against these currencies, especially against the Japanese yen, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. As a result, our operating results could be adversely
affected. As we increase Model S deliveries overseas during the rest of 2013 and beyond, as well as begin delivering powertrain units to Daimler, we may have greater revenues than costs denominated in other currencies, in which case a strengthening

vehicles generally and performance electric vehicles specifically. For example, we currently benefit from exemptions from California state sales and use taxes for purchases of up to $612 million of manufacturing equipment from our arrangements with
the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state sales and use tax, we believe this incentive would result in tax
savings by us through January 2015. This exemption is only available for equipment that would otherwise be subject to California sales and use taxes and that would be used only for specified purposes. If we fail to meet these conditions, we would be
unable to take full advantage of this tax incentive and our financial position could be harmed. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, certain regulations and laws that encourage sales of electric cars through tax
credits or other subsidies could be reduced, eliminated or applied in a way that creates an adverse effect against our vehicles, either currently or at any time in the future. For example, while the federal, state and foreign governments have from
time to time enacted tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel cars, funding for these programs is limited and there is no guarantee that our vehicles will be eligible for tax credits or other incentives provided to
alternative fuel vehicles in the future. This would put our vehicles at a competitive disadvantage. As an example at the state level, California renewed the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, a rebate program for the purchase of qualified alternative
technology vehicles for 2012, but reduced the rebate amount from $5,000 per vehicle to $2,500 per vehicle due to fewer funds available and increased demand. Moreover, such funds may run out or be limited in ways that would be adverse to purchasers
of our vehicles. Subsequent purchasers could face a delay in receiving rebates since they would have to wait until the next fiscal year&#146;s funding became available or be unable to obtain a rebate at all. Moreover, as more and more eligible EVs
are produced, California now faces a risk that the program will run out of funds prior to the end of the fiscal year.&nbsp;While California is looking at additional sources of funding for this program, other options under consideration are removing
eligibility for vehicles based on MSRP or customer income levels.&nbsp;If enacted, these measures would almost certainly impact us in an adverse manner by making either our vehicles or customers ineligible for rebates.&nbsp;As an additional example,
there is considerable discussion at the federal level over tax reform. Discussions have included reducing or even eliminating the current $7,500 tax credit available to purchasers of qualified alternative fuel vehicles, including Model S. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also, government programs have been enacted in Europe favoring the purchase of electric vehicles, including disincentives that discourage the
use of gas-powered vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees, or the 25% value added tax or other purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of
gas-powered vehicles. In the event that such government programs are reduced or eliminated, sales of electric vehicles, including our and Model S, could be adversely affected. </P>

customers may experience difficulty operating them properly, including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain. In certain instances, these
protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles. For example, we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most modes of vehicle operation. Our customers may become
accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle. However, when the vehicle is at maximum charge, the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed by the vehicle. Accordingly, our customers may
have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking. In addition, we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures. In such instances, the vehicle&#146;s acceleration and speed will
decrease. Finally, if the driver permits the battery pack to substantially deplete its charge, the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains. The vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a
stop. Despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge, the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected. There can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly, especially in these situations. Any accidents resulting
from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation, result in adverse publicity and product liability claims, and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating
results. In addition, if consumers dislike these features, they may choose not to buy additional cars from us, which could also harm our business and prospects. </P>

position. Any failure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in our competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Our
research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in electric vehicle technology. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the
latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, our vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles. For example, we do not
manufacture battery cells, which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we

senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing and support personnel and any failure
to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in retaining members of our senior management team as well as technical, vehicle

the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, software engineers, manufacturing engineers and other skilled employees and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones. Our continued success depends upon our
continued ability to hire and retain employees. Additionally, we compete with many mature and prosperous companies in Northern California that have far greater financial resources than we do and thus can offer current or perspective employees more

Environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws which may require us to
change our operations, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury and fines and penalties. Capital and
operating expenses needed to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our

can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural
resources. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the owner of the Fremont site, we may be responsible under federal and state laws and
regulations for the entire investigation and remediation of any environmental contamination at the Fremont site, whether it occurred before or after the date we purchased the property. We have reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten
year period, we will pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the closing of the purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions (Remediation
Activities), and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such Remediation Activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years
of our agreement, subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the ten-year anniversary
of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has been spent on Remediation Activities, whichever comes first, NUMMI&#146;s liability to us with respect to Remediation Activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at
the Fremont site. At that point in time, we have agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability, including attorney fees, or any costs or penalties it may incur arising out of or in connection with any claim relating to
environmental conditions and we have released NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for NUMMI&#146;s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement. As of September&nbsp;30, 2013, we have accrued $5.3 million related to
these environmental liabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are no assurances that NUMMI will perform its obligations under our agreement and NUMMI&#146;s
failure to perform would require us to undertake these obligations at a potentially significant cost and risk to our ability to increase the production capacity of, and operate, our Tesla Factory. Any Remediation Activities or other environmental

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many
employees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Our employees may join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union
signatory. Additionally, disgruntled ex-employees may actively encourage unionization of Tesla employees. Our automobile production facility in Fremont, California was purchased from NUMMI. Prior employees of NUMMI were union members and our future
work force at this facility may be inclined to vote in favor of forming a labor union. We are also directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work
stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicles and
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. The mere fact that our labor force could be unionized may harm our reputation in the eyes of some investors and thereby negatively affect our stock
price. Additionally, the unionization of our labor force could increase our employee costs and decrease our profitability, both of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </P>

year or 50,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty for the purchasers of Model S. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Model S covers the battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, depending on the size of the
vehicle&#146;s battery, although the battery&#146;s charging capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or any Extended Service plan. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period
after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Model S to cover additional services for an additional four years or 50,000 miles, provided it is purchased within a specified period of time. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty and Extended
Service plans for the Tesla Roadster and Model S are subject to certain limitations, exclusions or separate warranties, including certain wear items, such as tires, brake pads, paint and general appearance, and battery performance, and is intended
to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems, powertrain and brake system. We have previously provided our Tesla Roadster customers with a
battery replacement option to replace the battery in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We record and adjust warranty reserves based on changes in estimated costs and actual warranty costs. For new vehicles in particular, we
record warranty reserves based on management&#146;s best estimate of projected warranty experience until adequate historical data is accumulated over a period of time, generally a few quarters. As we have limited operating experience with Model S,
and therefore little experience with warranty claims for this vehicle, reserves that we recorded for Model&nbsp;S may be insufficient to cover all future warranty claims. Additionally, in April 2013, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the
customer ownership experience, we made the Model S battery warranty a &#147;no fault&#148; warranty and also eliminated the annual service requirement that was needed to keep the New Vehicle Limited Warranty in effect. Should this change in warranty
coverage lead to an increase in warranty claims, we may need to record additional warranty reserves which would negatively affect our profitability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since we began initiating sales of our vehicles, we have continued to refine our warranty reserves based on our actual warranty claim
experience and we may be required to undertake further changes in the future. As of September&nbsp;30, 2013, we had warranty reserves of $53.7 million, and such reserve amount will increase in the future as Model S is sold. We could in the future
become subject to a significant and unexpected warranty expense. There can be no assurances that our currently existing or future warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims due to potential higher average warranty expenses over the
product life cycle or that our limited experience with warranty claims will adequately address the needs of our customers to their satisfaction. </P>

unauthorized persons and would-be thieves.&nbsp;Our vehicles, and in particular Model S, are technologically advanced machines requiring the interoperation of numerous complex and evolving hardware and software systems.&nbsp;Subject to our
customers&#146; ability to opt out pursuant to our privacy policy, Model S is designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality of these systems.&nbsp;Although we
have designed, implemented and tested security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our vehicles and their systems, our information technology networks and communications with our vehicles may be vulnerable to interception, manipulation,
damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors by personnel who have access to our networks and systems.&nbsp;Any such attacks or breaches could result in unexpected changes to our vehicles&#146; functionality,
user interface and performance characteristics.&nbsp;Hackers may also use similar means to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle, such as its current geographical position, previous and stored destination address history and web
browser &#147;favorites.&#148;&nbsp;Any such unauthorized control of vehicles or access to or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and negative publicity, which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business,

of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns as well as other factors. How a customer uses their Tesla vehicle, the frequency of recharging the battery pack at a low state of
charge and the means of charging can result in additional deterioration of the battery pack&#146;s ability to hold a charge over the long term. For example, we currently expect that our battery pack for the Tesla Roadster will retain approximately
70% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle&#146;s initial range and power. Deterioration of the Model S battery pack is expected to be less than the
Roadster; however, such battery pack deterioration and the related decrease in range and power may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles, which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles. </P>

not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the United States as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to impose other limitations on
this sales model, including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state. In certain states in which we are not able to obtain
dealer licenses, we have worked with state regulators to open galleries, which are locations where potential customers can view our vehicles but are not full retail locations. It is possible that a state regulator could later determine that the
activities at our gallery constitute unlicensed sales of motor vehicles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to

structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these
issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, the manner in which the applicable authorities will apply
their state laws to our distribution model is difficult to predict. Such laws, as well as other laws governing the motor vehicle industry, may subject us to potential inquiries and investigations from state motor vehicle regulators who may question
whether our sales model complies with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws and who may require us to change our sales model or may prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with
applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. For example, in October 2012, vehicle dealer associations in New York and Massachusetts filed lawsuits to revoke the dealer license issued to Tesla Motors New York in New York and to limit the business
activity of Tesla Motors MA, Inc. in Massachusetts. These lawsuits have been dismissed, reinforcing our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. Possible similar challenges in other states, however, if
successful, could restrict or prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states. In some states, there have also been legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills that, if enacted, would prevent us from
obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and
dealer in Canada, Australia, and Japan, and have obtained licenses to sell vehicles in other places such as Hong Kong. Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model
and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in
jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. </P>

approximately 27.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of September&nbsp;30, 2013. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the
election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and

fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies&#146; stock, including ours, regardless of actual
operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock during the period following a securities offering. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the
market price of a particular company&#146;s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our

to require us to register shares of our common stock owned by them for public sale in the United States, subject to the restrictions of Rule 144. In addition, we have registered shares previously issued or reserved for future issuance under our
equity compensation plans and agreements, a portion of which are related to outstanding option awards. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and, in certain cases, lock-up agreements, the shares of common stock issued upon
exercise of outstanding options will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market. Sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity

2011 and June 2013. Interest on the loan accrues at market rates. Goldman Sachs Bank USA received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with these loans. As a regulated entity, Goldman Sachs Bank USA makes decisions regarding
making and managing its loans independent of Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&amp; Co. Mr.&nbsp;Musk and Goldman have a long-standing relationship of almost a decade. In addition, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC has made a loan to Mr.&nbsp;Musk in the aggregate

on the one hand, and Mr.&nbsp;Musk and the Trust on the other hand, prohibit the non-pledged shares currently owned by Mr.&nbsp;Musk and the Trust from being pledged to secure any other loans. These factors may limit Mr.&nbsp;Musk&#146;s ability to
either pledge additional shares of Tesla common stock or sell shares of Tesla common stock as a means to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged Tesla common stock in the event of a decline in our stock price that is large enough

issued pursuant to registered public offerings 1.50% convertible senior Notes due 2018 (the &#147;Notes&#148;). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance the Notes, depends on our future
performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any
future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling
assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Notes or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may
not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the Notes or future indebtedness. </P>

we will be obligated to make cash payments in respect of the principal amounts thereof, and we may also have to deliver shares of our common stock, in respect of such Notes. Any conversion of the Notes prior to their maturity, or acceleration of the

any payments to us would depend on the earnings or financial condition of our subsidiaries and various business considerations. Statutory, contractual or other restrictions may also limit our subsidiaries&#146; ability to pay dividends or make

change, which is a significant corporate change or event specified in the indenture, a holder of Notes has the right to require us to purchase such holder&#146;s Notes. However, the fundamental change provisions will not afford protection to holders
of Notes in the event of other transactions that could adversely affect the Notes. For example, transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations, refinancings, restructurings, or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute a fundamental change
requiring us to purchase the Notes. In the event of any such transaction, the holders would not have the right to require us to purchase the Notes, even though each of these transactions could increase the amount of our indebtedness, or otherwise
adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings, thereby adversely affecting the holders of Notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Recent regulatory

purchasers of, the Notes will employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes. Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to convertible debt instruments typically implement that
strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the convertible Notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or
in addition to short selling the common stock. As a result, any specific rules regulating equity swaps or short selling of securities or other governmental action that interferes with the ability of market participants to effect short sales or

required by the indenture or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a

May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement),
which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of
the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer&#146;s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is
that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders&#146; equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for
purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the
Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We report lower net income (or greater net loss) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period&#146;s amortization of the debt discount and the
instrument&#146;s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes. </P>

partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that
the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle
such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in
accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected. </P>

our common stock for Notes converted in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. The increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid
(or deemed to be paid) per share of our common stock in such transaction. The adjustment to the conversion rate for Notes converted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may not adequately compensate a holder of Notes for any lost
option value of such holder&#146;s Notes as a result of such transaction. In addition, if the price of our common stock in the transaction is greater than $225.00 per share or less than $92.24 per share (in each case, subject to adjustment), no

a dividend subject to U.S. federal income tax without the receipt of any cash. In addition, a failure to adjust (or to adjust adequately) the conversion rate after an event that increases the proportionate interest of a holder of Notes in us could
be treated as a deemed taxable dividend to such holder. If a make-whole fundamental change occurs on or prior to the maturity date, under some circumstances, we will increase the conversion rate for Notes converted in connection with the make-whole
fundamental change. Such increase may also be treated as a distribution subject to U.S. federal income tax as a dividend. If a holder of Notes is a non-United States holder for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any deemed dividend would be subject
to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty, which may be set off against subsequent payments on the Notes. </P>
